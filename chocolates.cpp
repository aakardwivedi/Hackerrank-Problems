    string s="Basically, in-kind support and maintenance (also known as ISM) is unearned income attributable to an SSI eligible individual in the form of food or shelter that is given to the individual or received because someone else pays for it.  In-kind support may be provided by someone who lives in the same household as the recipient (such as a parent), or by someone outside of the household.

In-kind support and maintenance matters in the SSI program because SSI is intended to help pay for the basic costs of food and shelter.  If someone else is helping to pay for these things, then it stands to reason that the SSI would be reduced.  If too much ISM is received and other forms of income are in evidence, it may even cause a person to be found ineligible for SSI benefits.  For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);
•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and
•	the relationship between a sponsor and a legal alien.

In these situations, SSA determines that a certain amount of the responsible party’s income and/or resources are “deemed” available for the welfare of the SSI claimant or recipient.  SSA considers this “deemed” income and/or resources when someone first applies for SSI, and when figuring the SSI payment amount for individuals already found eligible.  For more information about deeming, refer to additional briefing papers posted to the WIPA NTC website at: http://www.vcu-ntc.org/resources/briefpapers.cfm
If income is deemed from the parent(s) to an eligible child, SSA will NOT also charge ISM from the parent(s) to that child.  However, if in-kind support and maintenance is being provided to the eligible child by some other party from outside of the household, SSA will charge that to the child in addition to any income deemed from the parent(s).
Keep in mind that once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA considers the person to be an adult.  From that point forward, parent-to-child deeming stops.  As of the 18th birthday, SSA no longer considers the income or resources of the parents when making eligibility determinations and calculating payment amount.  There are no exceptions to this rule, even if the parents have been appointed as the legal guardian of the young adult with the disability.  Parent-to-child deeming never applies to an SSI recipient who is 18 years of age or older.
While the parent’s income and resources are no longer relevant once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA continues to be concerned about whether the parents (or anyone else for that matter) are helping the individual pay for the costs of food and shelter.  After the 18th birthday has occurred and the individual has successfully established eligibility for SSI under the adult rules, SSA will look to see whether or not in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is in evidence.  For an SSI recipient aged 18 or older, ISM may be provided from within the household by the parent(s), from outside of the household by any other party, or even from both.
In situations in which spouse-to-spouse or sponsor-to-alien deeming is occurring, similar ISM rules apply.  It is possible for ISM to be simultaneously assessed in situations where deeming occurs if the in-kind support and maintenance is provided by someone other than the deemor.  SSA will not charge ISM if it is provided by someone living in the same household whose income is already subject to deeming to the individual.


Relationship between ISM and Living Arrangement

The first step in the process of determining if ISM is in evidence is to determine which living arrangement (LA) the individual is in.  How in-kind support and maintenance is viewed by SSA and the value that is placed upon it depends upon the living arrangement an individual is determined to be in.  SSA begins this process by collecting evidence about the individual’s living situation and deciding whether the person resides in a “household” or “non-household”.   Social Security has very specific definitions that they apply here which are described below.

Non-Household Living Arrangements

A non-household situation exists if the recipient is either a transient or a resident of an institution.  A transient is defined by SSA as someone with no permanent living arrangement, or no fixed place of residence. A transient can be a homeless individual (i.e., someone who sleeps in doorways, overnight shelters, parks, bus stations, etc.); or a person who stays with a succession of friends or relatives and has no permanent living arrangement.

Residing in an institution (as defined for SSI purposes) can affect an SSI recipient's eligibility and/or payment amount.  Residents of public institutions generally are ineligible for SSI.  The reasoning here is that some other government source is already paying for the individual’s food and shelter, thus, SSI is not needed.  Residents of medical facilities (public or private) may be eligible, but are limited to a maximum Federal payment of $30 a month. However, there are many exceptions to these generalizations. Individuals living in a public shelter for the homeless may only be eligible for SSI for up to 6 months in any 9 month period.  This is an exception to the standard rules which is intended to help homeless persons prepare for more permanent living arrangements.

Household Living Arrangements

A household situation exists when an individual is not a transient or a resident of an institution. It is important to remember that the SSI program defines “household” differently than the physical space in which the beneficiary resides.  For SSI purposes, living within someone else’s household actually means that “someone else” takes financial responsibility for the SSI beneficiary.  Living in one’s own household means that the beneficiary has financial responsibility for his or her own food and shelter--does not equate to living alone.  Here are two examples:
Carol lives with her mother, Adriana.   Carol and her mom pay all costs equally for food, rent, utilities and other basic expenses. Carol receives SSI as a disabled individual.   For the purposes of SSI, Carol is living in her own household.

Carol moves out to an expensive apartment complex.  A rich friend has decided to pay all of Carol’s expenses, including rent, food, utilities, etc.  For the purposes of Carol’s SSI benefit, she is living in the household of another—even though she is living alone.

For purposes of living arrangement determinations and ISM, members of a household do not have to be related by blood or marriage. A person who is temporarily absent from a household is still a member of the household under some very specific circumstances.  SSA applies very specific rules to temporary absences which will be covered a bit later in this document.

Developing Living Arrangements (LA)
The Social Security Administration follows a prescribed sequence in developing an individual’s living arrangement (LA) to ensure that the correct ISM valuation rule is used and that possible sources of ISM are not overlooked or developed unnecessarily. SSA develops the living arrangement only for a person’s permanent residence.  For the purposes of developing LA, a residence is defined as the location of abode or dwelling place. A residence is also a place where a person makes his/her home. In SSA parlance, “residence” is synonymous with the term “permanent living arrangement.”  Below is a brief description of the standard federal living arrangements.
1.  Noninstitutional Care

This situation exists when an individual is placed by a public or private agency under a specific program of protective placement such as foster or family care. To qualify as non-institutional care, the placement must be a private dwelling (not an institution or commercial establishment) which is licensed or otherwise approved by the State to provide foster or family care. The placing agency retains responsibility for continuing supervision of the need for such placement and of the services provided. The individual, the placing agency, or some other third party pays for the food, shelter, and protective supervision provided. (See POMS SI 00835.790 Noninstitutional Care Situations for more information).

2.  Home Ownership

SSA considers an individual to be living in his/her own household when any form of ownership interest in the home belongs to the individual; his/her living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.110 - Home Ownership as LA Basis for more information.
3.  Rental Liability
An individual is living in his own household when there is liability to the landlord for payment of any of the rental charges on the part of the individual; the living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual. Room rental within a private dwelling is also a form of rental liability. When an individual lives in the same dwelling with the landlord, he/ she must be in a separate household from the landlord's in order to have rental liability. A separate household functions as a separate economic unit, and more than one economic unit may exist in a single dwelling. If the individual and the landlord do not function as separate economic units, the individual is not considered to be in a separate household and cannot have rental liability. An arrangement in which a flat fee for room and board is charged would be another form of rental liability. It is a variation of separate room rental within a private dwelling. With a flat fee arrangement, the individual maintains a separate household from the landlord and pays a flat rate for food and shelter.  See POMS SI 00835.120 - Rental Liability as LA Basis for more information.
4.  Public Assistance (PA) Households
A public assistance household is one in which every member receives some kind of public income maintenance payments (which this section refers to as “PA payments”). These are payments made under:
•	Title IV-A of the Social Security Act - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
•	Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI, including federally administered State supplements and State administered mandatory supplements);
•	The Refugee Act of 1980 (those payments based on need)
•	Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
•	General assistance programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
•	State or local government assistance programs based on need (tax credits or refunds are not assistance based on need), and
•	Department of Veterans Affairs programs (those payments based on need)
See POMS SI 00835.130 - Public Assistance Households for more information.
5.  Separate Consumption
Separate consumption means that an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) is taking all meals outside of the household in which he resides and is not reimbursed by the householder.  For separate consumption LA to apply, the individual must consume all of his/her meals elsewhere.  For more information, see SI 00835.140 - Separate Consumption
6.  Separate Purchase of Food
Separate purchase of food exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) physically shops for his/her own food or gives instructions and money to someone to buy the food for him/her.   Separate purchase of food can exist when an individual shops for his/ her own food but does not use his/her own money.   It may also apply even if the individual uses the same condiments or facilities (e.g., refrigerator, stove) as the rest of the household, or consumes meals at the same time as the rest of the household.  Separate purchase of food can also exist when an eligible spouse or a person whose income may be deemed to the individual buys food on behalf of the individual, but not necessarily only for the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.150 - Separate Purchase of Food for more information.
7.  Sharing
A sharing arrangement exists when an individual's contribution equals or exceeds his or her “pro rata” share of the household operating expenses, provided the household expenses include both food and shelter. Pro rata share is a term SSA uses to refer to an individual's share of the household operating expenses computed by dividing the household operating expenses by the number of persons permanently residing in the household. The pro rata share represents the dollar value of the individual's food and shelter received from within the household.  If the individual pays his/her pro rata share, he/she is not considered to be receiving any ISM from within the household. For additional information, refer to POMS SI 00835.160 - Sharing
8.  Earmarked Sharing
Earmarked sharing exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) designates part or all of his or her contribution toward household operating expenses for food or shelter and the contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of household expenses for food or shelter.  For example, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for shelter only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share for shelter, earmarked sharing exists.  Similarly, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for food only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of food expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of food expenses, earmarked sharing exists.
When an individual earmarks a specific portion of his contribution for food and another specific portion for shelter, it is called double earmarking. SSA computes the individual's pro rata share of food expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for food. Similarly, they compute the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for shelter. If either earmarked contribution equals or exceeds a pro rata share of the item for which it is earmarked (either food or shelter), earmarked sharing LA is determined.  See POMS SI 00835.170 - Earmarked Sharing for more information.
SSA gathers the information necessary to make LA determinations by interviewing the beneficiary and/or the representative payee or legal guardian.  The form SSA-8006-F4 is an interviewing and development tool which Claims Representatives often use for developing living arrangement (LA) and in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) issues. The answers to the questions on the SSA-8006-F4 document the individual's allegations regarding LA basis and cash income received from within and outside a household.
SSA may use an additional form (SSA-8011-F3) to verify things such as household operating expenses; the individual's contribution to household operating expenses, separate consumption, separate purchase of food, or earmarked contributions.  Samples of these forms are provided at the end of this document under the “Conducting Independent Research” section.
The LA decision is important because it determines which rule SSA uses to calculate the value of the ISM.  The value that is placed on the ISM is what affects the monthly SSI payment amount.  A detailed discussion of how the ISM valuation rules work is provided a bit later in this document.


Temporary Absences

Temporary absence is an individBasically, in-kind support and maintenance (also known as ISM) is unearned income attributable to an SSI eligible individual in the form of food or shelter that is given to the individual or received because someone else pays for it.  In-kind support may be provided by someone who lives in the same household as the recipient (such as a parent), or by someone outside of the household.

For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or

In-kind support may be provided by someone who lives in the same household as the recipient (such as a parent), or by someone outside of the household.

In-kind support and maintenance matters in the SSI program because SSI is intended to help pay for the basic costs of food and shelter.  If someone else is helping to pay for these things, then it stands to reason that the SSI would be reduced.  If too much ISM is received and other forms of income are in evidence, it may even cause a person to be found ineligible for SSI benefits.  For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);
•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and
•	the relationship between a sponsor and a legal alien.

In these situations, SSA determines that a certain amount of the responsible party’s income and/or resources are “deemed” available for the welfare of the SSI claimant or recipient.  SSA considers this “deemed” income and/or resources when someone first applies for SSI, and when figuring the SSI payment amount for individuals already found eligible.  For more information about deeming, refer to additional briefing papers posted to the WIPA NTC website at: http://www.vcu-ntc.org/resources/briefpapers.cfm
If income is deemed from the parent(s) to an eligible child, SSA will NOT also charge ISM from the parent(s) to that child.  However, if in-kind support and maintenance is being provided to the eligible child by some other party from outside of the household, SSA will charge that to the child in addition to any income deemed from the parent(s).
Keep in mind that once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA considers the person to be an adult.  From that point forward, parent-to-child deeming stops.  As of the 18th birthday, SSA no longer considers the income or resources of the parents when making eligibility determinations and calculating payment amount.  There are no exceptions to this rule, even if the parents have been appointed as the legal guardian of the young adult with the disability.  Parent-to-child deeming never applies to an SSI recipient who is 18 years of age or older.
While the parent’s income and resources are no longer relevant once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA continues to be concerned about whether the parents (or anyone else for that matter) are helping the individual pay for the costs of food and shelter.  After the 18th birthday has occurred and the individual has successfully established eligibility for SSI under the adult rules, SSA will look to see whether or not in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is in evidence.  For an SSI recipient aged 18 or older, ISM may be provided from within the household by the parent(s), from outside of the household by any other party, or even from both.
In situations in which spouse-to-spouse or sponsor-to-alien deeming is occurring, similar ISM rules apply.  It is possible for ISM to be simultaneously assessed in situations where deeming occurs if the in-kind support and maintenance is provided by someone other than the deemor.  SSA will not charge ISM if it is provided by someone living in the same household whose income is already subject to deeming to the individual.


Relationship between ISM and Living Arrangement

The first step in the process of determining if ISM is in evidence is to determine which living arrangement (LA) the individual is in.  How in-kind support and maintenance is viewed by SSA and the value that is placed upon it depends upon the living arrangement an individual is determined to be in.  SSA begins this process by collecting evidence about the individual’s living situation and deciding whether the person resides in a “household” or “non-household”.   Social Security has very specific definitions that they apply here which are described below.

Non-Household Living Arrangements

A non-household situation exists if the recipient is either a transient or a resident of an institution.  A transient is defined by SSA as someone with no permanent living arrangement, or no fixed place of residence. A transient can be a homeless individual (i.e., someone who sleeps in doorways, overnight shelters, parks, bus stations, etc.); or a person who stays with a succession of friends or relatives and has no permanent living arrangement.

Residing in an institution (as defined for SSI purposes) can affect an SSI recipient's eligibility and/or payment amount.  Residents of public institutions generally are ineligible for SSI.  The reasoning here is that some other government source is already paying for the individual’s food and shelter, thus, SSI is not needed.  Residents of medical facilities (public or private) may be eligible, but are limited to a maximum Federal payment of $30 a month. However, there are many exceptions to these generalizations. Individuals living in a public shelter for the homeless may only be eligible for SSI for up to 6 months in any 9 month period.  This is an exception to the standard rules which is intended to help homeless persons prepare for more permanent living arrangements.

Household Living Arrangements

A household situation exists when an individual is not a transient or a resident of an institution. It is important to remember that the SSI program defines “household” differently than the physical space in which the beneficiary resides.  For SSI purposes, living within someone else’s household actually means that “someone else” takes financial responsibility for the SSI beneficiary.  Living in one’s own household means that the beneficiary has financial responsibility for his or her own food and shelter--does not equate to living alone.  Here are two examples:
Carol lives with her mother, Adriana.   Carol and her mom pay all costs equally for food, rent, utilities and other basic expenses. Carol receives SSI as a disabled individual.   For the purposes of SSI, Carol is living in her own household.

Carol moves out to an expensive apartment complex.  A rich friend has decided to pay all of Carol’s expenses, including rent, food, utilities, etc.  For the purposes of Carol’s SSI benefit, she is living in the household of another—even though she is living alone.

For purposes of living arrangement determinations and ISM, members of a household do not have to be related by blood or marriage. A person who is temporarily absent from a household is still a member of the household under some very specific circumstances.  SSA applies very specific rules to temporary absences which will be covered a bit later in this document.

Developing Living Arrangements (LA)
The Social Security Administration follows a prescribed sequence in developing an individual’s living arrangement (LA) to ensure that the correct ISM valuation rule is used and that possible sources of ISM are not overlooked or developed unnecessarily. SSA develops the living arrangement only for a person’s permanent residence.  For the purposes of developing LA, a residence is defined as the location of abode or dwelling place. A residence is also a place where a person makes his/her home. In SSA parlance, “residence” is synonymous with the term “permanent living arrangement.”  Below is a brief description of the standard federal living arrangements.
1.  Noninstitutional Care

This situation exists when an individual is placed by a public or private agency under a specific program of protective placement such as foster or family care. To qualify as non-institutional care, the placement must be a private dwelling (not an institution or commercial establishment) which is licensed or otherwise approved by the State to provide foster or family care. The placing agency retains responsibility for continuing supervision of the need for such placement and of the services provided. The individual, the placing agency, or some other third party pays for the food, shelter, and protective supervision provided. (See POMS SI 00835.790 Noninstitutional Care Situations for more information).

2.  Home Ownership

SSA considers an individual to be living in his/her own household when any form of ownership interest in the home belongs to the individual; his/her living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.110 - Home Ownership as LA Basis for more information.
3.  Rental Liability
An individual is living in his own household when there is liability to the landlord for payment of any of the rental charges on the part of the individual; the living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual. Room rental within a private dwelling is also a form of rental liability. When an individual lives in the same dwelling with the landlord, he/ she must be in a separate household from the landlord's in order to have rental liability. A separate household functions as a separate economic unit, and more than one economic unit may exist in a single dwelling. If the individual and the landlord do not function as separate economic units, the individual is not considered to be in a separate household and cannot have rental liability. An arrangement in which a flat fee for room and board is charged would be another form of rental liability. It is a variation of separate room rental within a private dwelling. With a flat fee arrangement, the individual maintains a separate household from the landlord and pays a flat rate for food and shelter.  See POMS SI 00835.120 - Rental Liability as LA Basis for more information.
4.  Public Assistance (PA) Households
A public assistance household is one in which every member receives some kind of public income maintenance payments (which this section refers to as “PA payments”). These are payments made under:
•	Title IV-A of the Social Security Act - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
•	Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI, including federally administered State supplements and State administered mandatory supplements);
•	The Refugee Act of 1980 (those payments based on need)
•	Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
•	General assistance programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
•	State or local government assistance programs based on need (tax credits or refunds are not assistance based on need), and
•	Department of Veterans Affairs programs (those payments based on need)
See POMS SI 00835.130 - Public Assistance Households for more information.
5.  Separate Consumption
Separate consumption means that an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) is taking all meals outside of the household in which he resides and is not reimbursed by the householder.  For separate consumption LA to apply, the individual must consume all of his/her meals elsewhere.  For more information, see SI 00835.140 - Separate Consumption
6.  Separate Purchase of Food
Separate purchase of food exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) physically shops for his/her own food or gives instructions and money to someone to buy the food for him/her.   Separate purchase of food can exist when an individual shops for his/ her own food but does not use his/her own money.   It may also apply even if the individual uses the same condiments or facilities (e.g., refrigerator, stove) as the rest of the household, or consumes meals at the same time as the rest of the household.  Separate purchase of food can also exist when an eligible spouse or a person whose income may be deemed to the individual buys food on behalf of the individual, but not necessarily only for the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.150 - Separate Purchase of Food for more information.
7.  Sharing
A sharing arrangement exists when an individual's contribution equals or exceeds his or her “pro rata” share of the household operating expenses, provided the household expenses include both food and shelter. Pro rata share is a term SSA uses to refer to an individual's share of the household operating expenses computed by dividing the household operating expenses by the number of persons permanently residing in the household. The pro rata share represents the dollar value of the individual's food and shelter received from within the household.  If the individual pays his/her pro rata share, he/she is not considered to be receiving any ISM from within the household. For additional information, refer to POMS SI 00835.160 - Sharing
8.  Earmarked Sharing
Earmarked sharing exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) designates part or all of his or her contribution toward household operating expenses for food or shelter and the contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of household expenses for food or shelter.  For example, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for shelter only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share for shelter, earmarked sharing exists.  Similarly, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for food only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of food expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of food expenses, earmarked sharing exists.
When an individual earmarks a specific portion of his contribution for food and another specific portion for shelter, it is called double earmarking. SSA computes the individual's pro rata share of food expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for food. Similarly, they compute the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for shelter. If either earmarked contribution equals or exceeds a pro rata share of the item for which it is earmarked (either food or shelter), earmarked sharing LA is determined.  See POMS SI 00835.170 - Earmarked Sharing for more information.
SSA gathers the information necessary to make LA determinations by interviewing the beneficiary and/or the representative payee or legal guardian.  The form SSA-8006-F4 is an interviewing and development tool which Claims Representatives often use for developing living arrangement (LA) and in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) issues. The answers to the questions on the SSA-8006-F4 document the individual's allegations regarding LA basis and cash income received from within and outside a household.
SSA may use an additional form (SSA-8011-F3) to verify things such as household operating expenses; the individual's contribution to household operating expenses, separate consumption, separate purchase of food, or earmarked contributions.  Samples of these forms are provided at the end of this document under the “Conducting Independent Research” section.
The LA decision is important because it determines which rule SSA uses to calculate the value of the ISM.  The value that is placed on the ISM is what affects the monthly SSI payment amount.  A detailed discussion of how the ISM valuation rules work is provided a bit later in this document.

In-kind support and maintenance matters in the SSI program because SSI is intended to help pay for the basic costs of food and shelter.  If someone else is helping to pay for these things, then it stands to reason that the SSI would be reduced.  If too much ISM is received and other forms of income are in evidence, it may even cause a person to be found ineligible for SSI benefits.  For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);
•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and
•	the relationship between a sponsor and a legal alien.

In these situations, SSA determines that a certain amount of the responsible party’s income and/or resources are “deemed” available for the welfare of the SSI claimant or recipient.  SSA considers this “deemed” income and/or resources when someone first applies for SSI, and when figuring the SSI payment amount for individuals already found eligible.  For more information about deeming, refer to additional briefing papers posted to the WIPA NTC website at: http://www.vcu-ntc.org/resources/briefpapers.cfm
If income is deemed from the parent(s) to an eligible child, SSA will NOT also charge ISM from the parent(s) to that child.  However, if in-kind support and maintenance is being provided to the eligible child by some other party from outside of the household, SSA will charge that to the child in addition to any income deemed from the parent(s).
Keep in mind that once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA considers the person to be an adult.  From that point forward, parent-to-child deeming stops.  As of the 18th birthday, SSA no longer considers the income or resources of the parents when making eligibility determinations and calculating payment amount.  There are no exceptions to this rule, even if the parents have been appointed as the legal guardian of the young adult with the disability.  Parent-to-child deeming never applies to an SSI recipient who is 18 years of age or older.
While the parent’s income and resources are no longer relevant once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA continues to be concerned about whether the parents (or anyone else for that matter) are helping the individual pay for the costs of food and shelter.  After the 18th birthday has occurred and the individual has successfully established eligibility for SSI under the adult rules, SSA will look to see whether or not in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is in evidence.  For an SSI recipient aged 18 or older, ISM may be provided from within the household by the parent(s), from outside of the household by any other party, or even from both.
In situations in which spouse-to-spouse or sponsor-to-alien deeming is occurring, similar ISM rules apply.  It is possible for ISM to be simultaneously assessed in situations where deeming occurs if the in-kind support and maintenance is provided by someone other than the deemor.  SSA will not charge ISM if it is provided by someone living in the same household whose income is already subject to deeming to the individual.


Relationship between ISM and Living Arrangement

The first step in the process of determining if ISM is in evidence is to determine which living arrangement (LA) the individual is in.  How in-kind support and maintenance is viewed by SSA and the value that is placed upon it depends upon the living arrangement an individual is determined to be in.  SSA begins this process by collecting evidence about the individual’s living situation and deciding whether the person resides in a “household” or “non-household”.   Social Security has very specific definitions that they apply here which are described below.

Non-Household Living Arrangements

A non-household situation exists if the recipient is either a transient or a resident of an institution.  A transient is defined by SSA as someone with no permanent living arrangement, or no fixed place of residence. A transient can be a homeless individual (i.e., someone who sleeps in doorways, overnight shelters, parks, bus stations, etc.); or a person who stays with a succession of friends or relatives and has no permanent living arrangement.

Residing in an institution (as defined for SSI purposes) can affect an SSI recipient's eligibility and/or payment amount.  Residents of public institutions generally are ineligible for SSI.  The reasoning here is that some other government source is already paying for the individual’s food and shelter, thus, SSI is not needed.  Residents of medical facilities (public or private) may be eligible, but are limited to a maximum Federal payment of $30 a month. However, there are many exceptions to these generalizations. Individuals living in a public shelter for the homeless may only be eligible for SSI for up to 6 months in any 9 month period.  This is an exception to the standard rules which is intended to help homeless persons prepare for more permanent living arrangements.

Household Living Arrangements

A household situation exists when an individual is not a transient or a resident of an institution. It is important to remember that the SSI program defines “household” differently than the physical space in which the beneficiary resides.  For SSI purposes, living within someone else’s household actually means that “someone else” takes financial responsibility for the SSI beneficiary.  Living in one’s own household means that the beneficiary has financial responsibility for his or her own food and shelter--does not equate to living alone.  Here are two examples:
Carol lives with her mother, Adriana.   Carol and her mom pay all costs equally for food, rent, utilities and other basic expenses. Carol receives SSI as a disabled individual.   For the purposes of SSI, Carol is living in her own household.

Carol moves out to an expensive apartment complex.  A rich friend has decided to pay all of Carol’s expenses, including rent, food, utilities, etc.  For the purposes of Carol’s SSI benefit, she is living in the household of another—even though she is living alone.

For purposes of living arrangement determinations and ISM, members of a household do not have to be related by blood or marriage. A person who is temporarily absent from a household is still a member of the household under some very specific circumstances.  SSA applies very specific rules to temporary absences which will be covered a bit later in this document.

Developing Living Arrangements (LA)
The Social Security Administration follows a prescribed sequence in developing an individual’s living arrangement (LA) to ensure that the correct ISM valuation rule is used and that possible sources of ISM are not overlooked or developed unnecessarily. SSA develops the living arrangement only for a person’s permanent residence.  For the purposes of developing LA, a residence is defined as the location of abode or dwelling place. A residence is also a place where a person makes his/her home. In SSA parlance, “residence” is synonymous with the term “permanent living arrangement.”  Below is a brief description of the standard federal living arrangements.
1.  Noninstitutional Care

This situation exists when an individual is placed by a public or private agency under a specific program of protective placement such as foster or family care. To qualify as non-institutional care, the placement must be a private dwelling (not an institution or commercial establishment) which is licensed or otherwise approved by the State to provide foster or family care. The placing agency retains responsibility for continuing supervision of the need for such placement and of the services provided. The individual, the placing agency, or some other third party pays for the food, shelter, and protective supervision provided. (See POMS SI 00835.790 Noninstitutional Care Situations for more information).

2.  Home Ownership

SSA considers an individual to be living in his/her own household when any form of ownership interest in the home belongs to the individual; his/her living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.110 - Home Ownership as LA Basis for more information.
3.  Rental Liability
An individual is living in his own household when there is liability to the landlord for payment of any of the rental charges on the part of the individual; the living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual. Room rental within a private dwelling is also a form of rental liability. When an individual lives in the same dwelling with the landlord, he/ she must be in a separate household from the landlord's in order to have rental liability. A separate household functions as a separate economic unit, and more than one economic unit may exist in a single dwelling. If the individual and the landlord do not function as separate economic units, the individual is not considered to be in a separate household and cannot have rental liability. An arrangement in which a flat fee for room and board is charged would be another form of rental liability. It is a variation of separate room rental within a private dwelling. With a flat fee arrangement, the individual maintains a separate household from the landlord and pays a flat rate for food and shelter.  See POMS SI 00835.120 - Rental Liability as LA Basis for more information.
4.  Public Assistance (PA) Households
A public assistance household is one in which every member receives some kind of public income maintenance payments (which this section refers to as “PA payments”). These are payments made under:
•	Title IV-A of the Social Security Act - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
•	Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI, including federally administered State supplements and State administered mandatory supplements);
•	The Refugee Act of 1980 (those payments based on need)
•	Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
•	General assistance programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
•	State or local government assistance programs based on need (tax credits or refunds are not assistance based on need), and
•	Department of Veterans Affairs programs (those payments based on need)
See POMS SI 00835.130 - Public Assistance Households for more information.
5.  Separate Consumption
Separate consumption means that an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) is taking all meals outside of the household in which he resides and is not reimbursed by the householder.  For separate consumption LA to apply, the individual must consume all of his/her meals elsewhere.  For more information, see SI 00835.140 - Separate Consumption
6.  Separate Purchase of Food
Separate purchase of food exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) physically shops for his/her own food or gives instructions and money to someone to buy the food for him/her.   Separate purchase of food can exist when an individual shops for his/ her own food but does not use his/her own money.   It may also apply even if the individual uses the same condiments or facilities (e.g., refrigerator, stove) as the rest of the household, or consumes meals at the same time as the rest of the household.  Separate purchase of food can also exist when an eligible spouse or a person whose income may be deemed to the individual buys food on behalf of the individual, but not necessarily only for the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.150 - Separate Purchase of Food for more information.
7.  Sharing
A sharing arrangement exists when an individual's contribution equals or exceeds his or her “pro rata” share of the household operating expenses, provided the household expenses include both food and shelter. Pro rata share is a term SSA uses to refer to an individual's share of the household operating expenses computed by dividing the household operating expenses by the number of persons permanently residing in the household. The pro rata share represents the dollar value of the individual's food and shelter received from within the household.  If the individual pays his/her pro rata share, he/she is not considered to be receiving any ISM from within the household. For additional information, refer to POMS SI 00835.160 - Sharing
8.  Earmarked Sharing
Earmarked sharing exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) designates part or all of his or her contribution toward household operating expenses for food or shelter and the contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of household expenses for food or shelter.  For example, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for shelter only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share for shelter, earmarked sharing exists.  Similarly, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for food only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of food expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of food expenses, earmarked sharing exists.
When an individual earmarks a specific portion of his contribution for food and another specific portion for shelter, it is called double earmarking. SSA computes the individual's pro rata share of food expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for food. Similarly, they compute the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for shelter. If either earmarked contribution equals or exceeds a pro rata share of the item for which it is earmarked (either food or shelter), earmarked sharing LA is determined.  See POMS SI 00835.170 - Earmarked Sharing for more information.
SSA gathers the information necessary to make LA determinations by interviewing the beneficiary and/or the representative payee or legal guardian.  The form SSA-8006-F4 is an interviewing and development tool which Claims Representatives often use for developing living arrangement (LA) and in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) issues. The answers to the questions on the SSA-8006-F4 document the individual's allegations regarding LA basis and cash income received from within and outside a household.
SSA may use an additional form (SSA-8011-F3) to verify things such as household operating expenses; the individual's contribution to household operating expenses, separate consumption, separate purchase of food, or earmarked contributions.  Samples of these forms are provided at the end of this document under the “Conducting Independent Research” section.
The LA decision is important because it determines which rule SSA uses to calculate the value of the ISM.  The value that is placed on the ISM is what affects the monthly SSI payment amount.  A detailed discussion of how the ISM valuation rules work is provided a bit later in this document.

•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);

If someone else is helping to pay for these things, then it stands to reason that the SSI would be reduced.  If too much ISM is received and other forms of income are in evidence, it may even cause a person to be found ineligible for SSI benefits.  For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);
•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and
•	the relationship between a sponsor and a legal alien.

In these situations, SSA determines that a certain amount of the responsible party’s income and/or resources are “deemed” available for the welfare of the SSI claimant or recipient.  SSA considers this “deemed” income and/or resources when someone first applies for SSI, and when figuring the SSI payment amount for individuals already found eligible.  For more information about deeming, refer to additional briefing papers posted to the WIPA NTC website at: http://www.vcu-ntc.org/resources/briefpapers.cfm
If income is deemed from the parent(s) to an eligible child, SSA will NOT also charge ISM from the parent(s) to that child.  However, if in-kind support and maintenance is being provided to the eligible child by some other party from outside of the household, SSA will charge that to the child in addition to any income deemed from the parent(s).
Keep in mind that once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA considers the person to be an adult.  From that point forward, parent-to-child deeming stops.  As of the 18th birthday, SSA no longer considers the income or resources of the parents when making eligibility determinations and calculating payment amount.  There are no exceptions to this rule, even if the parents have been appointed as the legal guardian of the young adult with the disability.  Parent-to-child deeming never applies to an SSI recipient who is 18 years of age or older.
While the parent’s income and resources are no longer relevant once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA continues to be concerned about whether the parents (or anyone else for that matter) are helping the individual pay for the costs of food and shelter.  After the 18th birthday has occurred and the individual has successfully established eligibility for SSI under the adult rules, SSA will look to see whether or not in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is in evidence.  For an SSI recipient aged 18 or older, ISM may be provided from within the household by the parent(s), from outside of the household by any other party, or even from both.
In situations in which spouse-to-spouse or sponsor-to-alien deeming is occurring, similar ISM rules apply.  It is possible for ISM to be simultaneously assessed in situations where deeming occurs if the in-kind support and maintenance is provided by someone other than the deemor.  SSA will not charge ISM if it is provided by someone living in the same household whose income is already subject to deeming to the individual.


Relationship between ISM and Living Arrangement

The first step in the process of determining if ISM is in evidence is to determine which living arrangement (LA) the individual is in.  How in-kind support and maintenance is viewed by SSA and the value that is placed upon it depends upon the living arrangement an individual is determined to be in.  SSA begins this process by collecting evidence about the individual’s living situation and deciding whether the person resides in a “household” or “non-household”.   Social Security has very specific definitions that they apply here which are described below.

Non-Household Living Arrangements

A non-household situation exists if the recipient is either a transient or a resident of an institution.  A transient is defined by SSA as someone with no permanent living arrangement, or no fixed place of residence. A transient can be a homeless individual (i.e., someone who sleeps in doorways, overnight shelters, parks, bus stations, etc.); or a person who stays with a succession of friends or relatives and has no permanent living arrangement.

Residing in an institution (as defined for SSI purposes) can affect an SSI recipient's eligibility and/or payment amount.  Residents of public institutions generally are ineligible for SSI.  The reasoning here is that some other government source is already paying for the individual’s food and shelter, thus, SSI is not needed.  Residents of medical facilities (public or private) may be eligible, but are limited to a maximum Federal payment of $30 a month. However, there are many exceptions to these generalizations. Individuals living in a public shelter for the homeless may only be eligible for SSI for up to 6 months in any 9 month period.  This is an exception to the standard rules which is intended to help homeless persons prepare for more permanent living arrangements.

Household Living Arrangements

A household situation exists when an individual is not a transient or a resident of an institution. It is important to remember that the SSI program defines “household” differently than the physical space in which the beneficiary resides.  For SSI purposes, living within someone else’s household actually means that “someone else” takes financial responsibility for the SSI beneficiary.  Living in one’s own household means that the beneficiary has financial responsibility for his or her own food and shelter--does not equate to living alone.  Here are two examples:
Carol lives with her mother, Adriana.   Carol and her mom pay all costs equally for food, rent, utilities and other basic expenses. Carol receives SSI as a disabled individual.   For the purposes of SSI, Carol is living in her own household.

Carol moves out to an expensive apartment complex.  A rich friend has decided to pay all of Carol’s expenses, including rent, food, utilities, etc.  For the purposes of Carol’s SSI benefit, she is living in the household of another—even though she is living alone.

For purposes of living arrangement determinations and ISM, members of a household do not have to be related by blood or marriage. A person who is temporarily absent from a household is still a member of the household under some very specific circumstances.  SSA applies very specific rules to temporary absences which will be covered a bit later in this document.

Developing Living Arrangements (LA)
The Social Security Administration follows a prescribed sequence in developing an individual’s living arrangement (LA) to ensure that the correct ISM valuation rule is used and that possible sources of ISM are not overlooked or developed unnecessarily. SSA develops the living arrangement only for a person’s permanent residence.  For the purposes of developing LA, a residence is defined as the location of abode or dwelling place. A residence is also a place where a person makes his/her home. In SSA parlance, “residence” is synonymous with the term “permanent living arrangement.”  Below is a brief description of the standard federal living arrangements.
1.  Noninstitutional Care

This situation exists when an individual is placed by a public or private agency under a specific program of protective placement such as foster or family care. To qualify as non-institutional care, the placement must be a private dwelling (not an institution or commercial establishment) which is licensed or otherwise approved by the State to provide foster or family care. The placing agency retains responsibility for continuing supervision of the need for such placement and of the services provided. The individual, the placing agency, or some other third party pays for the food, shelter, and protective supervision provided. (See POMS SI 00835.790 Noninstitutional Care Situations for more information).

2.  Home Ownership

SSA considers an individual to be living in his/her own household when any form of ownership interest in the home belongs to the individual; his/her living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.110 - Home Ownership as LA Basis for more information.
3.  Rental Liability
An individual is living in his own household when there is liability to the landlord for payment of any of the rental charges on the part of the individual; the living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual. Room rental within a private dwelling is also a form of rental liability. When an individual lives in the same dwelling with the landlord, he/ she must be in a separate household from the landlord's in order to have rental liability. A separate household functions as a separate economic unit, and more than one economic unit may exist in a single dwelling. If the individual and the landlord do not function as separate economic units, the individual is not considered to be in a separate household and cannot have rental liability. An arrangement in which a flat fee for room and board is charged would be another form of rental liability. It is a variation of separate room rental within a private dwelling. With a flat fee arrangement, the individual maintains a separate household from the landlord and pays a flat rate for food and shelter.  See POMS SI 00835.120 - Rental Liability as LA Basis for more information.
4.  Public Assistance (PA) Households
A public assistance household is one in which every member receives some kind of public income maintenance payments (which this section refers to as “PA payments”). These are payments made under:
•	Title IV-A of the Social Security Act - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
•	Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI, including federally administered State supplements and State administered mandatory supplements);
•	The Refugee Act of 1980 (those payments based on need)
•	Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
•	General assistance programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
•	State or local government assistance programs based on need (tax credits or refunds are not assistance based on need), and
•	Department of Veterans Affairs programs (those payments based on need)
See POMS SI 00835.130 - Public Assistance Households for more information.
5.  Separate Consumption
Separate consumption means that an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) is taking all meals outside of the household in which he resides and is not reimbursed by the householder.  For separate consumption LA to apply, the individual must consume all of his/her meals elsewhere.  For more information, see SI 00835.140 - Separate Consumption
6.  Separate Purchase of Food
Separate purchase of food exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) physically shops for his/her own food or gives instructions and money to someone to buy the food for him/her.   Separate purchase of food can exist when an individual shops for his/ her own food but does not use his/her own money.   It may also apply even if the individual uses the same condiments or facilities (e.g., refrigerator, stove) as the rest of the household, or consumes meals at the same time as the rest of the household.  Separate purchase of food can also exist when an eligible spouse or a person whose income may be deemed to the individual buys food on behalf of the individual, but not necessarily only for the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.150 - Separate Purchase of Food for more information.
7.  Sharing
A sharing arrangement exists when an individual's contribution equals or exceeds his or her “pro rata” share of the household operating expenses, provided the household expenses include both food and shelter. Pro rata share is a term SSA uses to refer to an individual's share of the household operating expenses computed by dividing the household operating expenses by the number of persons permanently residing in the household. The pro rata share represents the dollar value of the individual's food and shelter received from within the household.  If the individual pays his/her pro rata share, he/she is not considered to be receiving any ISM from within the household. For additional information, refer to POMS SI 00835.160 - Sharing
8.  Earmarked Sharing
Earmarked sharing exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) designates part or all of his or her contribution toward household operating expenses for food or shelter and the contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of household expenses for food or shelter.  For example, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for shelter only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share for shelter, earmarked sharing exists.  Similarly, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for food only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of food expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of food expenses, earmarked sharing exists.
When an individual earmarks a specific portion of his contribution for food and another specific portion for shelter, it is called double earmarking. SSA computes the individual's pro rata share of food expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for food. Similarly, they compute the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for shelter. If either earmarked contribution equals or exceeds a pro rata share of the item for which it is earmarked (either food or shelter), earmarked sharing LA is determined.  See POMS SI 00835.170 - Earmarked Sharing for more information.
SSA gathers the information necessary to make LA determinations by interviewing the beneficiary and/or the representative payee or legal guardian.  The form SSA-8006-F4 is an interviewing and development tool which Claims Representatives often use for developing living arrangement (LA) and in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) issues. The answers to the questions on the SSA-8006-F4 document the individual's allegations regarding LA basis and cash income received from within and outside a household.
SSA may use an additional form (SSA-8011-F3) to verify things such as household operating expenses; the individual's contribution to household operating expenses, separate consumption, separate purchase of food, or earmarked contributions.  Samples of these forms are provided at the end of this document under the “Conducting Independent Research” section.
The LA decision is important because it determines which rule SSA uses to calculate the value of the ISM.  The value that is placed on the ISM is what affects the monthly SSI payment amount.  A detailed discussion of how the ISM valuation rules work is provided a bit later in this document.


Temporary Absences

Temporary absence is an individBasically, in-kind support and maintenance (also known as ISM) is unearned income attributable to an SSI eligible individual in the form of food or shelter that is given to the individual or received because someone else pays for it.  In-kind support may be provided by someone who lives in the same household as the recipient (such as a parent), or by someone outside of the household.

In-kind support and maintenance matters in the SSI program because SSI is intended to help pay for the basic costs of food and shelter.  If someone else is helping to pay for these things, then it stands to reason that the SSI would be reduced.  If too much ISM is received and other forms of income are in evidence, it may even cause a person to be found ineligible for SSI benefits.  For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received.

•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

If too much ISM is received and other forms of income are in evidence, it may even cause a person to be found ineligible for SSI benefits.  For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);
•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and
•	the relationship between a sponsor and a legal alien.

In these situations, SSA determines that a certain amount of the responsible party’s income and/or resources are “deemed” available for the welfare of the SSI claimant or recipient.  SSA considers this “deemed” income and/or resources when someone first applies for SSI, and when figuring the SSI payment amount for individuals already found eligible.  For more information about deeming, refer to additional briefing papers posted to the WIPA NTC website at: http://www.vcu-ntc.org/resources/briefpapers.cfm
If income is deemed from the parent(s) to an eligible child, SSA will NOT also charge ISM from the parent(s) to that child.  However, if in-kind support and maintenance is being provided to the eligible child by some other party from outside of the household, SSA will charge that to the child in addition to any income deemed from the parent(s).
Keep in mind that once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA considers the person to be an adult.  From that point forward, parent-to-child deeming stops.  As of the 18th birthday, SSA no longer considers the income or resources of the parents when making eligibility determinations and calculating payment amount.  There are no exceptions to this rule, even if the parents have been appointed as the legal guardian of the young adult with the disability.  Parent-to-child deeming never applies to an SSI recipient who is 18 years of age or older.
While the parent’s income and resources are no longer relevant once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA continues to be concerned about whether the parents (or anyone else for that matter) are helping the individual pay for the costs of food and shelter.  After the 18th birthday has occurred and the individual has successfully established eligibility for SSI under the adult rules, SSA will look to see whether or not in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is in evidence.  For an SSI recipient aged 18 or older, ISM may be provided from within the household by the parent(s), from outside of the household by any other party, or even from both.
In situations in which spouse-to-spouse or sponsor-to-alien deeming is occurring, similar ISM rules apply.  It is possible for ISM to be simultaneously assessed in situations where deeming occurs if the in-kind support and maintenance is provided by someone other than the deemor.  SSA will not charge ISM if it is provided by someone living in the same household whose income is already subject to deeming to the individual.


Relationship between ISM and Living Arrangement

The first step in the process of determining if ISM is in evidence is to determine which living arrangement (LA) the individual is in.  How in-kind support and maintenance is viewed by SSA and the value that is placed upon it depends upon the living arrangement an individual is determined to be in.  SSA begins this process by collecting evidence about the individual’s living situation and deciding whether the person resides in a “household” or “non-household”.   Social Security has very specific definitions that they apply here which are described below.

Non-Household Living Arrangements

A non-household situation exists if the recipient is either a transient or a resident of an institution.  A transient is defined by SSA as someone with no permanent living arrangement, or no fixed place of residence. A transient can be a homeless individual (i.e., someone who sleeps in doorways, overnight shelters, parks, bus stations, etc.); or a person who stays with a succession of friends or relatives and has no permanent living arrangement.

Residing in an institution (as defined for SSI purposes) can affect an SSI recipient's eligibility and/or payment amount.  Residents of public institutions generally are ineligible for SSI.  The reasoning here is that some other government source is already paying for the individual’s food and shelter, thus, SSI is not needed.  Residents of medical facilities (public or private) may be eligible, but are limited to a maximum Federal payment of $30 a month. However, there are many exceptions to these generalizations. Individuals living in a public shelter for the homeless may only be eligible for SSI for up to 6 months in any 9 month period.  This is an exception to the standard rules which is intended to help homeless persons prepare for more permanent living arrangements.

Household Living Arrangements

A household situation exists when an individual is not a transient or a resident of an institution. It is important to remember that the SSI program defines “household” differently than the physical space in which the beneficiary resides.  For SSI purposes, living within someone else’s household actually means that “someone else” takes financial responsibility for the SSI beneficiary.  Living in one’s own household means that the beneficiary has financial responsibility for his or her own food and shelter--does not equate to living alone.  Here are two examples:
Carol lives with her mother, Adriana.   Carol and her mom pay all costs equally for food, rent, utilities and other basic expenses. Carol receives SSI as a disabled individual.   For the purposes of SSI, Carol is living in her own household.

Carol moves out to an expensive apartment complex.  A rich friend has decided to pay all of Carol’s expenses, including rent, food, utilities, etc.  For the purposes of Carol’s SSI benefit, she is living in the household of another—even though she is living alone.

For purposes of living arrangement determinations and ISM, members of a household do not have to be related by blood or marriage. A person who is temporarily absent from a household is still a member of the household under some very specific circumstances.  SSA applies very specific rules to temporary absences which will be covered a bit later in this document.

Developing Living Arrangements (LA)
The Social Security Administration follows a prescribed sequence in developing an individual’s living arrangement (LA) to ensure that the correct ISM valuation rule is used and that possible sources of ISM are not overlooked or developed unnecessarily. SSA develops the living arrangement only for a person’s permanent residence.  For the purposes of developing LA, a residence is defined as the location of abode or dwelling place. A residence is also a place where a person makes his/her home. In SSA parlance, “residence” is synonymous with the term “permanent living arrangement.”  Below is a brief description of the standard federal living arrangements.
1.  Noninstitutional Care

This situation exists when an individual is placed by a public or private agency under a specific program of protective placement such as foster or family care. To qualify as non-institutional care, the placement must be a private dwelling (not an institution or commercial establishment) which is licensed or otherwise approved by the State to provide foster or family care. The placing agency retains responsibility for continuing supervision of the need for such placement and of the services provided. The individual, the placing agency, or some other third party pays for the food, shelter, and protective supervision provided. (See POMS SI 00835.790 Noninstitutional Care Situations for more information).

2.  Home Ownership

SSA considers an individual to be living in his/her own household when any form of ownership interest in the home belongs to the individual; his/her living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.110 - Home Ownership as LA Basis for more information.
3.  Rental Liability
An individual is living in his own household when there is liability to the landlord for payment of any of the rental charges on the part of the individual; the living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual. Room rental within a private dwelling is also a form of rental liability. When an individual lives in the same dwelling with the landlord, he/ she must be in a separate household from the landlord's in order to have rental liability. A separate household functions as a separate economic unit, and more than one economic unit may exist in a single dwelling. If the individual and the landlord do not function as separate economic units, the individual is not considered to be in a separate household and cannot have rental liability. An arrangement in which a flat fee for room and board is charged would be another form of rental liability. It is a variation of separate room rental within a private dwelling. With a flat fee arrangement, the individual maintains a separate household from the landlord and pays a flat rate for food and shelter.  See POMS SI 00835.120 - Rental Liability as LA Basis for more information.
4.  Public Assistance (PA) Households
A public assistance household is one in which every member receives some kind of public income maintenance payments (which this section refers to as “PA payments”). These are payments made under:
•	Title IV-A of the Social Security Act - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
•	Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI, including federally administered State supplements and State administered mandatory supplements);
•	The Refugee Act of 1980 (those payments based on need)
•	Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
•	General assistance programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
•	State or local government assistance programs based on need (tax credits or refunds are not assistance based on need), and
•	Department of Veterans Affairs programs (those payments based on need)
See POMS SI 00835.130 - Public Assistance Households for more information.
5.  Separate Consumption
Separate consumption means that an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) is taking all meals outside of the household in which he resides and is not reimbursed by the householder.  For separate consumption LA to apply, the individual must consume all of his/her meals elsewhere.  For more information, see SI 00835.140 - Separate Consumption
6.  Separate Purchase of Food
Separate purchase of food exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) physically shops for his/her own food or gives instructions and money to someone to buy the food for him/her.   Separate purchase of food can exist when an individual shops for his/ her own food but does not use his/her own money.   It may also apply even if the individual uses the same condiments or facilities (e.g., refrigerator, stove) as the rest of the household, or consumes meals at the same time as the rest of the household.  Separate purchase of food can also exist when an eligible spouse or a person whose income may be deemed to the individual buys food on behalf of the individual, but not necessarily only for the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.150 - Separate Purchase of Food for more information.
7.  Sharing
A sharing arrangement exists when an individual's contribution equals or exceeds his or her “pro rata” share of the household operating expenses, provided the household expenses include both food and shelter. Pro rata share is a term SSA uses to refer to an individual's share of the household operating expenses computed by dividing the household operating expenses by the number of persons permanently residing in the household. The pro rata share represents the dollar value of the individual's food and shelter received from within the household.  If the individual pays his/her pro rata share, he/she is not considered to be receiving any ISM from within the household. For additional information, refer to POMS SI 00835.160 - Sharing
8.  Earmarked Sharing
Earmarked sharing exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) designates part or all of his or her contribution toward household operating expenses for food or shelter and the contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of household expenses for food or shelter.  For example, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for shelter only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share for shelter, earmarked sharing exists.  Similarly, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for food only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of food expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of food expenses, earmarked sharing exists.
When an individual earmarks a specific portion of his contribution for food and another specific portion for shelter, it is called double earmarking. SSA computes the individual's pro rata share of food expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for food. Similarly, they compute the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for shelter. If either earmarked contribution equals or exceeds a pro rata share of the item for which it is earmarked (either food or shelter), earmarked sharing LA is determined.  See POMS SI 00835.170 - Earmarked Sharing for more information.
SSA gathers the information necessary to make LA determinations by interviewing the beneficiary and/or the representative payee or legal guardian.  The form SSA-8006-F4 is an interviewing and development tool which Claims Representatives often use for developing living arrangement (LA) and in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) issues. The answers to the questions on the SSA-8006-F4 document the individual's allegations regarding LA basis and cash income received from within and outside a household.
SSA may use an additional form (SSA-8011-F3) to verify things such as household operating expenses; the individual's contribution to household operating expenses, separate consumption, separate purchase of food, or earmarked contributions.  Samples of these forms are provided at the end of this document under the “Conducting Independent Research” section.
The LA decision is important because it determines which rule SSA uses to calculate the value of the ISM.  The value that is placed on the ISM is what affects the monthly SSI payment amount.  A detailed discussion of how the ISM valuation rules work is provided a bit later in this document.


Temporary Absences

Temporary absence is an individBasically, in-kind support and maintenance (also known as ISM) is unearned income attributable to an SSI eligible individual in the form of food or shelter that is given to the individual or received because someone else pays for it.  In-kind support may be provided by someone who lives in the same household as the recipient (such as a parent), or by someone outside of the household.

In-kind support and maintenance matters in the SSI program because SSI is intended to help pay for the basic costs of food and shelter.  If someone else is helping to pay for these things, then it stands to reason that the SSI would be reduced.  If too much ISM is received and other forms of income are in evidence, it may even cause a person to be found ineligible for SSI benefits.  For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received.

•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);
•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and
•	the relationship between a sponsor and a legal alien.

In these situations, SSA determines that a certain amount of the responsible party’s income and/or resources are “deemed” available for the welfare of the SSI claimant or recipient.  SSA considers this “deemed” income and/or resources when someone first applies for SSI, and when figuring the SSI payment amount for individuals already found eligible.  For more information about deeming, refer to additional briefing papers posted to the WIPA NTC website at: http://www.vcu-ntc.org/resources/briefpapers.cfm
If income is deemed from the parent(s) to an eligible child, SSA will NOT also charge ISM from the parent(s) to that child.  However, if in-kind support and maintenance is being provided to the eligible child by some other party from outside of the household, SSA will charge that to the child in addition to any income deemed from the parent(s).
Keep in mind that once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA considers the person to be an adult.  From that point forward, parent-to-child deeming stops.  As of the 18th birthday, SSA no longer considers the income or resources of the parents when making eligibility determinations and calculating payment amount.  There are no exceptions to this rule, even if the parents have been appointed as the legal guardian of the young adult with the disability.  Parent-to-child deeming never applies to an SSI recipient who is 18 years of age or older.
While the parent’s income and resources are no longer relevant once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA continues to be concerned about whether the parents (or anyone else for that matter) are helping the individual pay for the costs of food and shelter.  After the 18th birthday has occurred and the individual has successfully established eligibility for SSI under the adult rules, SSA will look to see whether or not in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is in evidence.  For an SSI recipient aged 18 or older, ISM may be provided from within the household by the parent(s), from outside of the household by any other party, or even from both.
In situations in which spouse-to-spouse or sponsor-to-alien deeming is occurring, similar ISM rules apply.  It is possible for ISM to be simultaneously assessed in situations where deeming occurs if the in-kind support and maintenance is provided by someone other than the deemor.  SSA will not charge ISM if it is provided by someone living in the same household whose income is already subject to deeming to the individual.


Relationship between ISM and Living Arrangement

The first step in the process of determining if ISM is in evidence is to determine which living arrangement (LA) the individual is in.  How in-kind support and maintenance is viewed by SSA and the value that is placed upon it depends upon the living arrangement an individual is determined to be in.  SSA begins this process by collecting evidence about the individual’s living situation and deciding whether the person resides in a “household” or “non-household”.   Social Security has very specific definitions that they apply here which are described below.

Non-Household Living Arrangements

A non-household situation exists if the recipient is either a transient or a resident of an institution.  A transient is defined by SSA as someone with no permanent living arrangement, or no fixed place of residence. A transient can be a homeless individual (i.e., someone who sleeps in doorways, overnight shelters, parks, bus stations, etc.); or a person who stays with a succession of friends or relatives and has no permanent living arrangement.

Residing in an institution (as defined for SSI purposes) can affect an SSI recipient's eligibility and/or payment amount.  Residents of public institutions generally are ineligible for SSI.  The reasoning here is that some other government source is already paying for the individual’s food and shelter, thus, SSI is not needed.  Residents of medical facilities (public or private) may be eligible, but are limited to a maximum Federal payment of $30 a month. However, there are many exceptions to these generalizations. Individuals living in a public shelter for the homeless may only be eligible for SSI for up to 6 months in any 9 month period.  This is an exception to the standard rules which is intended to help homeless persons prepare for more permanent living arrangements.

Household Living Arrangements

A household situation exists when an individual is not a transient or a resident of an institution. It is important to remember that the SSI program defines “household” differently than the physical space in which the beneficiary resides.  For SSI purposes, living within someone else’s household actually means that “someone else” takes financial responsibility for the SSI beneficiary.  Living in one’s own household means that the beneficiary has financial responsibility for his or her own food and shelter--does not equate to living alone.  Here are two examples:
Carol lives with her mother, Adriana.   Carol and her mom pay all costs equally for food, rent, utilities and other basic expenses. Carol receives SSI as a disabled individual.   For the purposes of SSI, Carol is living in her own household.

Carol moves out to an expensive apartment complex.  A rich friend has decided to pay all of Carol’s expenses, including rent, food, utilities, etc.  For the purposes of Carol’s SSI benefit, she is living in the household of another—even though she is living alone.

For purposes of living arrangement determinations and ISM, members of a household do not have to be related by blood or marriage. A person who is temporarily absent from a household is still a member of the household under some very specific circumstances.  SSA applies very specific rules to temporary absences which will be covered a bit later in this document.

Developing Living Arrangements (LA)
The Social Security Administration follows a prescribed sequence in developing an individual’s living arrangement (LA) to ensure that the correct ISM valuation rule is used and that possible sources of ISM are not overlooked or developed unnecessarily. SSA develops the living arrangement only for a person’s permanent residence.  For the purposes of developing LA, a residence is defined as the location of abode or dwelling place. A residence is also a place where a person makes his/her home. In SSA parlance, “residence” is synonymous with the term “permanent living arrangement.”  Below is a brief description of the standard federal living arrangements.
1.  Noninstitutional Care

This situation exists when an individual is placed by a public or private agency under a specific program of protective placement such as foster or family care. To qualify as non-institutional care, the placement must be a private dwelling (not an institution or commercial establishment) which is licensed or otherwise approved by the State to provide foster or family care. The placing agency retains responsibility for continuing supervision of the need for such placement and of the services provided. The individual, the placing agency, or some other third party pays for the food, shelter, and protective supervision provided. (See POMS SI 00835.790 Noninstitutional Care Situations for more information).

2.  Home Ownership

SSA considers an individual to be living in his/her own household when any form of ownership interest in the home belongs to the individual; his/her living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.110 - Home Ownership as LA Basis for more information.
3.  Rental Liability
An individual is living in his own household when there is liability to the landlord for payment of any of the rental charges on the part of the individual; the living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual. Room rental within a private dwelling is also a form of rental liability. When an individual lives in the same dwelling with the landlord, he/ she must be in a separate household from the landlord's in order to have rental liability. A separate household functions as a separate economic unit, and more than one economic unit may exist in a single dwelling. If the individual and the landlord do not function as separate economic units, the individual is not considered to be in a separate household and cannot have rental liability. An arrangement in which a flat fee for room and board is charged would be another form of rental liability. It is a variation of separate room rental within a private dwelling. With a flat fee arrangement, the individual maintains a separate household from the landlord and pays a flat rate for food and shelter.  See POMS SI 00835.120 - Rental Liability as LA Basis for more information.
4.  Public Assistance (PA) Households
A public assistance household is one in which every member receives some kind of public income maintenance payments (which this section refers to as “PA payments”). These are payments made under:
•	Title IV-A of the Social Security Act - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
•	Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI, including federally administered State supplements and State administered mandatory supplements);
•	The Refugee Act of 1980 (those payments based on need)
•	Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
•	General assistance programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
•	State or local government assistance programs based on need (tax credits or refunds are not assistance based on need), and
•	Department of Veterans Affairs programs (those payments based on need)
See POMS SI 00835.130 - Public Assistance Households for more information.
5.  Separate Consumption
Separate consumption means that an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) is taking all meals outside of the household in which he resides and is not reimbursed by the householder.  For separate consumption LA to apply, the individual must consume all of his/her meals elsewhere.  For more information, see SI 00835.140 - Separate Consumption
6.  Separate Purchase of Food
Separate purchase of food exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) physically shops for his/her own food or gives instructions and money to someone to buy the food for him/her.   Separate purchase of food can exist when an individual shops for his/ her own food but does not use his/her own money.   It may also apply even if the individual uses the same condiments or facilities (e.g., refrigerator, stove) as the rest of the household, or consumes meals at the same time as the rest of the household.  Separate purchase of food can also exist when an eligible spouse or a person whose income may be deemed to the individual buys food on behalf of the individual, but not necessarily only for the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.150 - Separate Purchase of Food for more information.
7.  Sharing
A sharing arrangement exists when an individual's contribution equals or exceeds his or her “pro rata” share of the household operating expenses, provided the household expenses include both food and shelter. Pro rata share is a term SSA uses to refer to an individual's share of the household operating expenses computed by dividing the household operating expenses by the number of persons permanently residing in the household. The pro rata share represents the dollar value of the individual's food and shelter received from within the household.  If the individual pays his/her pro rata share, he/she is not considered to be receiving any ISM from within the household. For additional information, refer to POMS SI 00835.160 - Sharing
8.  Earmarked Sharing
Earmarked sharing exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) designates part or all of his or her contribution toward household operating expenses for food or shelter and the contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of household expenses for food or shelter.  For example, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for shelter only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share for shelter, earmarked sharing exists.  Similarly, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for food only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of food expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of food expenses, earmarked sharing exists.
When an individual earmarks a specific portion of his contribution for food and another specific portion for shelter, it is called double earmarking. SSA computes the individual's pro rata share of food expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for food. Similarly, they compute the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for shelter. If either earmarked contribution equals or exceeds a pro rata share of the item for which it is earmarked (either food or shelter), earmarked sharing LA is determined.  See POMS SI 00835.170 - Earmarked Sharing for more information.
SSA gathers the information necessary to make LA determinations by interviewing the beneficiary and/or the representative payee or legal guardian.  The form SSA-8006-F4 is an interviewing and development tool which Claims Representatives often use for developing living arrangement (LA) and in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) issues. The answers to the questions on the SSA-8006-F4 document the individual's allegations regarding LA basis and cash income received from within and outside a household.
SSA may use an additional form (SSA-8011-F3) to verify things such as household operating expenses; the individual's contribution to household operating expenses, separate consumption, separate purchase of food, or earmarked contributions.  Samples of these forms are provided at the end of this document under the “Conducting Independent Research” section.
The LA decision is important because it determines which rule SSA uses to calculate the value of the ISM.  The value that is placed on the ISM is what affects the monthly SSI payment amount.  A detailed discussion of how the ISM valuation rules work is provided a bit later in this document.


Temporary Absences

Temporary absence is an individBasically, in-kind support and maintenance (also known as ISM) is unearned income attributable to an SSI eligible individual in the form of food or shelter that is given to the individual or received because someone else pays for it.  In-kind support may be provided by someone who lives in the same household as the recipient (such as a parent), or by someone outside of the household.

In-kind support and maintenance matters in the SSI program because SSI is intended to help pay for the basic costs of food and shelter.  If someone else is helping to pay for these things, then it stands to reason that the SSI would be reduced.  If too much ISM is received and other forms of income are in evidence, it may even cause a person to be found ineligible for SSI benefits.  For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);

•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);
•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and
•	the relationship between a sponsor and a legal alien.

In these situations, SSA determines that a certain amount of the responsible party’s income and/or resources are “deemed” available for the welfare of the SSI claimant or recipient.  SSA considers this “deemed” income and/or resources when someone first applies for SSI, and when figuring the SSI payment amount for individuals already found eligible.  For more information about deeming, refer to additional briefing papers posted to the WIPA NTC website at: http://www.vcu-ntc.org/resources/briefpapers.cfm
If income is deemed from the parent(s) to an eligible child, SSA will NOT also charge ISM from the parent(s) to that child.  However, if in-kind support and maintenance is being provided to the eligible child by some other party from outside of the household, SSA will charge that to the child in addition to any income deemed from the parent(s).
Keep in mind that once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA considers the person to be an adult.  From that point forward, parent-to-child deeming stops.  As of the 18th birthday, SSA no longer considers the income or resources of the parents when making eligibility determinations and calculating payment amount.  There are no exceptions to this rule, even if the parents have been appointed as the legal guardian of the young adult with the disability.  Parent-to-child deeming never applies to an SSI recipient who is 18 years of age or older.
While the parent’s income and resources are no longer relevant once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA continues to be concerned about whether the parents (or anyone else for that matter) are helping the individual pay for the costs of food and shelter.  After the 18th birthday has occurred and the individual has successfully established eligibility for SSI under the adult rules, SSA will look to see whether or not in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is in evidence.  For an SSI recipient aged 18 or older, ISM may be provided from within the household by the parent(s), from outside of the household by any other party, or even from both.
In situations in which spouse-to-spouse or sponsor-to-alien deeming is occurring, similar ISM rules apply.  It is possible for ISM to be simultaneously assessed in situations where deeming occurs if the in-kind support and maintenance is provided by someone other than the deemor.  SSA will not charge ISM if it is provided by someone living in the same household whose income is already subject to deeming to the individual.


Relationship between ISM and Living Arrangement

The first step in the process of determining if ISM is in evidence is to determine which living arrangement (LA) the individual is in.  How in-kind support and maintenance is viewed by SSA and the value that is placed upon it depends upon the living arrangement an individual is determined to be in.  SSA begins this process by collecting evidence about the individual’s living situation and deciding whether the person resides in a “household” or “non-household”.   Social Security has very specific definitions that they apply here which are described below.

Non-Household Living Arrangements

A non-household situation exists if the recipient is either a transient or a resident of an institution.  A transient is defined by SSA as someone with no permanent living arrangement, or no fixed place of residence. A transient can be a homeless individual (i.e., someone who sleeps in doorways, overnight shelters, parks, bus stations, etc.); or a person who stays with a succession of friends or relatives and has no permanent living arrangement.

Residing in an institution (as defined for SSI purposes) can affect an SSI recipient's eligibility and/or payment amount.  Residents of public institutions generally are ineligible for SSI.  The reasoning here is that some other government source is already paying for the individual’s food and shelter, thus, SSI is not needed.  Residents of medical facilities (public or private) may be eligible, but are limited to a maximum Federal payment of $30 a month. However, there are many exceptions to these generalizations. Individuals living in a public shelter for the homeless may only be eligible for SSI for up to 6 months in any 9 month period.  This is an exception to the standard rules which is intended to help homeless persons prepare for more permanent living arrangements.

Household Living Arrangements

A household situation exists when an individual is not a transient or a resident of an institution. It is important to remember that the SSI program defines “household” differently than the physical space in which the beneficiary resides.  For SSI purposes, living within someone else’s household actually means that “someone else” takes financial responsibility for the SSI beneficiary.  Living in one’s own household means that the beneficiary has financial responsibility for his or her own food and shelter--does not equate to living alone.  Here are two examples:
Carol lives with her mother, Adriana.   Carol and her mom pay all costs equally for food, rent, utilities and other basic expenses. Carol receives SSI as a disabled individual.   For the purposes of SSI, Carol is living in her own household.

Carol moves out to an expensive apartment complex.  A rich friend has decided to pay all of Carol’s expenses, including rent, food, utilities, etc.  For the purposes of Carol’s SSI benefit, she is living in the household of another—even though she is living alone.

For purposes of living arrangement determinations and ISM, members of a household do not have to be related by blood or marriage. A person who is temporarily absent from a household is still a member of the household under some very specific circumstances.  SSA applies very specific rules to temporary absences which will be covered a bit later in this document.

Developing Living Arrangements (LA)
The Social Security Administration follows a prescribed sequence in developing an individual’s living arrangement (LA) to ensure that the correct ISM valuation rule is used and that possible sources of ISM are not overlooked or developed unnecessarily. SSA develops the living arrangement only for a person’s permanent residence.  For the purposes of developing LA, a residence is defined as the location of abode or dwelling place. A residence is also a place where a person makes his/her home. In SSA parlance, “residence” is synonymous with the term “permanent living arrangement.”  Below is a brief description of the standard federal living arrangements.
1.  Noninstitutional Care

This situation exists when an individual is placed by a public or private agency under a specific program of protective placement such as foster or family care. To qualify as non-institutional care, the placement must be a private dwelling (not an institution or commercial establishment) which is licensed or otherwise approved by the State to provide foster or family care. The placing agency retains responsibility for continuing supervision of the need for such placement and of the services provided. The individual, the placing agency, or some other third party pays for the food, shelter, and protective supervision provided. (See POMS SI 00835.790 Noninstitutional Care Situations for more information).

2.  Home Ownership

SSA considers an individual to be living in his/her own household when any form of ownership interest in the home belongs to the individual; his/her living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.110 - Home Ownership as LA Basis for more information.
3.  Rental Liability
An individual is living in his own household when there is liability to the landlord for payment of any of the rental charges on the part of the individual; the living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual. Room rental within a private dwelling is also a form of rental liability. When an individual lives in the same dwelling with the landlord, he/ she must be in a separate household from the landlord's in order to have rental liability. A separate household functions as a separate economic unit, and more than one economic unit may exist in a single dwelling. If the individual and the landlord do not function as separate economic units, the individual is not considered to be in a separate household and cannot have rental liability. An arrangement in which a flat fee for room and board is charged would be another form of rental liability. It is a variation of separate room rental within a private dwelling. With a flat fee arrangement, the individual maintains a separate household from the landlord and pays a flat rate for food and shelter.  See POMS SI 00835.120 - Rental Liability as LA Basis for more information.
4.  Public Assistance (PA) Households
A public assistance household is one in which every member receives some kind of public income maintenance payments (which this section refers to as “PA payments”). These are payments made under:
•	Title IV-A of the Social Security Act - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
•	Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI, including federally administered State supplements and State administered mandatory supplements);
•	The Refugee Act of 1980 (those payments based on need)
•	Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
•	General assistance programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
•	State or local government assistance programs based on need (tax credits or refunds are not assistance based on need), and
•	Department of Veterans Affairs programs (those payments based on need)
See POMS SI 00835.130 - Public Assistance Households for more information.
5.  Separate Consumption
Separate consumption means that an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) is taking all meals outside of the household in which he resides and is not reimbursed by the householder.  For separate consumption LA to apply, the individual must consume all of his/her meals elsewhere.  For more information, see SI 00835.140 - Separate Consumption
6.  Separate Purchase of Food
Separate purchase of food exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) physically shops for his/her own food or gives instructions and money to someone to buy the food for him/her.   Separate purchase of food can exist when an individual shops for his/ her own food but does not use his/her own money.   It may also apply even if the individual uses the same condiments or facilities (e.g., refrigerator, stove) as the rest of the household, or consumes meals at the same time as the rest of the household.  Separate purchase of food can also exist when an eligible spouse or a person whose income may be deemed to the individual buys food on behalf of the individual, but not necessarily only for the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.150 - Separate Purchase of Food for more information.
7.  Sharing
A sharing arrangement exists when an individual's contribution equals or exceeds his or her “pro rata” share of the household operating expenses, provided the household expenses include both food and shelter. Pro rata share is a term SSA uses to refer to an individual's share of the household operating expenses computed by dividing the household operating expenses by the number of persons permanently residing in the household. The pro rata share represents the dollar value of the individual's food and shelter received from within the household.  If the individual pays his/her pro rata share, he/she is not considered to be receiving any ISM from within the household. For additional information, refer to POMS SI 00835.160 - Sharing
8.  Earmarked Sharing
Earmarked sharing exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) designates part or all of his or her contribution toward household operating expenses for food or shelter and the contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of household expenses for food or shelter.  For example, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for shelter only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share for shelter, earmarked sharing exists.  Similarly, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for food only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of food expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of food expenses, earmarked sharing exists.
When an individual earmarks a specific portion of his contribution for food and another specific portion for shelter, it is called double earmarking. SSA computes the individual's pro rata share of food expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for food. Similarly, they compute the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for shelter. If either earmarked contribution equals or exceeds a pro rata share of the item for which it is earmarked (either food or shelter), earmarked sharing LA is determined.  See POMS SI 00835.170 - Earmarked Sharing for more information.
SSA gathers the information necessary to make LA determinations by interviewing the beneficiary and/or the representative payee or legal guardian.  The form SSA-8006-F4 is an interviewing and development tool which Claims Representatives often use for developing living arrangement (LA) and in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) issues. The answers to the questions on the SSA-8006-F4 document the individual's allegations regarding LA basis and cash income received from within and outside a household.
SSA may use an additional form (SSA-8011-F3) to verify things such as household operating expenses; the individual's contribution to household operating expenses, separate consumption, separate purchase of food, or earmarked contributions.  Samples of these forms are provided at the end of this document under the “Conducting Independent Research” section.
The LA decision is important because it determines which rule SSA uses to calculate the value of the ISM.  The value that is placed on the ISM is what affects the monthly SSI payment amount.  A detailed discussion of how the ISM valuation rules work is provided a bit later in this document.


Temporary Absences

Temporary absence is an individBasically, in-kind support and maintenance (also known as ISM) is unearned income attributable to an SSI eligible individual in the form of food or shelter that is given to the individual or received because someone else pays for it.  In-kind support may be provided by someone who lives in the same household as the recipient (such as a parent), or by someone outside of the household.

In-kind support and maintenance matters in the SSI program because SSI is intended to help pay for the basic costs of food and shelter.  If someone else is helping to pay for these things, then it stands to reason that the SSI would be reduced.  If too much ISM is received and other forms of income are in evidence, it may even cause a person to be found ineligible for SSI benefits.  For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations.

•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);
•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and
•	the relationship between a sponsor and a legal alien.

In these situations, SSA determines that a certain amount of the responsible party’s income and/or resources are “deemed” available for the welfare of the SSI claimant or recipient.  SSA considers this “deemed” income and/or resources when someone first applies for SSI, and when figuring the SSI payment amount for individuals already found eligible.  For more information about deeming, refer to additional briefing papers posted to the WIPA NTC website at: http://www.vcu-ntc.org/resources/briefpapers.cfm
If income is deemed from the parent(s) to an eligible child, SSA will NOT also charge ISM from the parent(s) to that child.  However, if in-kind support and maintenance is being provided to the eligible child by some other party from outside of the household, SSA will charge that to the child in addition to any income deemed from the parent(s).
Keep in mind that once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA considers the person to be an adult.  From that point forward, parent-to-child deeming stops.  As of the 18th birthday, SSA no longer considers the income or resources of the parents when making eligibility determinations and calculating payment amount.  There are no exceptions to this rule, even if the parents have been appointed as the legal guardian of the young adult with the disability.  Parent-to-child deeming never applies to an SSI recipient who is 18 years of age or older.
While the parent’s income and resources are no longer relevant once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA continues to be concerned about whether the parents (or anyone else for that matter) are helping the individual pay for the costs of food and shelter.  After the 18th birthday has occurred and the individual has successfully established eligibility for SSI under the adult rules, SSA will look to see whether or not in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is in evidence.  For an SSI recipient aged 18 or older, ISM may be provided from within the household by the parent(s), from outside of the household by any other party, or even from both.
In situations in which spouse-to-spouse or sponsor-to-alien deeming is occurring, similar ISM rules apply.  It is possible for ISM to be simultaneously assessed in situations where deeming occurs if the in-kind support and maintenance is provided by someone other than the deemor.  SSA will not charge ISM if it is provided by someone living in the same household whose income is already subject to deeming to the individual.


Relationship between ISM and Living Arrangement

The first step in the process of determining if ISM is in evidence is to determine which living arrangement (LA) the individual is in.  How in-kind support and maintenance is viewed by SSA and the value that is placed upon it depends upon the living arrangement an individual is determined to be in.  SSA begins this process by collecting evidence about the individual’s living situation and deciding whether the person resides in a “household” or “non-household”.   Social Security has very specific definitions that they apply here which are described below.

Non-Household Living Arrangements

A non-household situation exists if the recipient is either a transient or a resident of an institution.  A transient is defined by SSA as someone with no permanent living arrangement, or no fixed place of residence. A transient can be a homeless individual (i.e., someone who sleeps in doorways, overnight shelters, parks, bus stations, etc.); or a person who stays with a succession of friends or relatives and has no permanent living arrangement.

Residing in an institution (as defined for SSI purposes) can affect an SSI recipient's eligibility and/or payment amount.  Residents of public institutions generally are ineligible for SSI.  The reasoning here is that some other government source is already paying for the individual’s food and shelter, thus, SSI is not needed.  Residents of medical facilities (public or private) may be eligible, but are limited to a maximum Federal payment of $30 a month. However, there are many exceptions to these generalizations. Individuals living in a public shelter for the homeless may only be eligible for SSI for up to 6 months in any 9 month period.  This is an exception to the standard rules which is intended to help homeless persons prepare for more permanent living arrangements.

Household Living Arrangements

A household situation exists when an individual is not a transient or a resident of an institution. It is important to remember that the SSI program defines “household” differently than the physical space in which the beneficiary resides.  For SSI purposes, living within someone else’s household actually means that “someone else” takes financial responsibility for the SSI beneficiary.  Living in one’s own household means that the beneficiary has financial responsibility for his or her own food and shelter--does not equate to living alone.  Here are two examples:
Carol lives with her mother, Adriana.   Carol and her mom pay all costs equally for food, rent, utilities and other basic expenses. Carol receives SSI as a disabled individual.   For the purposes of SSI, Carol is living in her own household.

Carol moves out to an expensive apartment complex.  A rich friend has decided to pay all of Carol’s expenses, including rent, food, utilities, etc.  For the purposes of Carol’s SSI benefit, she is living in the household of another—even though she is living alone.

For purposes of living arrangement determinations and ISM, members of a household do not have to be related by blood or marriage. A person who is temporarily absent from a household is still a member of the household under some very specific circumstances.  SSA applies very specific rules to temporary absences which will be covered a bit later in this document.

Developing Living Arrangements (LA)
The Social Security Administration follows a prescribed sequence in developing an individual’s living arrangement (LA) to ensure that the correct ISM valuation rule is used and that possible sources of ISM are not overlooked or developed unnecessarily. SSA develops the living arrangement only for a person’s permanent residence.  For the purposes of developing LA, a residence is defined as the location of abode or dwelling place. A residence is also a place where a person makes his/her home. In SSA parlance, “residence” is synonymous with the term “permanent living arrangement.”  Below is a brief description of the standard federal living arrangements.
1.  Noninstitutional Care

This situation exists when an individual is placed by a public or private agency under a specific program of protective placement such as foster or family care. To qualify as non-institutional care, the placement must be a private dwelling (not an institution or commercial establishment) which is licensed or otherwise approved by the State to provide foster or family care. The placing agency retains responsibility for continuing supervision of the need for such placement and of the services provided. The individual, the placing agency, or some other third party pays for the food, shelter, and protective supervision provided. (See POMS SI 00835.790 Noninstitutional Care Situations for more information).

2.  Home Ownership

SSA considers an individual to be living in his/her own household when any form of ownership interest in the home belongs to the individual; his/her living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.110 - Home Ownership as LA Basis for more information.
3.  Rental Liability
An individual is living in his own household when there is liability to the landlord for payment of any of the rental charges on the part of the individual; the living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual. Room rental within a private dwelling is also a form of rental liability. When an individual lives in the same dwelling with the landlord, he/ she must be in a separate household from the landlord's in order to have rental liability. A separate household functions as a separate economic unit, and more than one economic unit may exist in a single dwelling. If the individual and the landlord do not function as separate economic units, the individual is not considered to be in a separate household and cannot have rental liability. An arrangement in which a flat fee for room and board is charged would be another form of rental liability. It is a variation of separate room rental within a private dwelling. With a flat fee arrangement, the individual maintains a separate household from the landlord and pays a flat rate for food and shelter.  See POMS SI 00835.120 - Rental Liability as LA Basis for more information.
4.  Public Assistance (PA) Households
A public assistance household is one in which every member receives some kind of public income maintenance payments (which this section refers to as “PA payments”). These are payments made under:
•	Title IV-A of the Social Security Act - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
•	Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI, including federally administered State supplements and State administered mandatory supplements);
•	The Refugee Act of 1980 (those payments based on need)
•	Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
•	General assistance programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
•	State or local government assistance programs based on need (tax credits or refunds are not assistance based on need), and
•	Department of Veterans Affairs programs (those payments based on need)
See POMS SI 00835.130 - Public Assistance Households for more information.
5.  Separate Consumption
Separate consumption means that an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) is taking all meals outside of the household in which he resides and is not reimbursed by the householder.  For separate consumption LA to apply, the individual must consume all of his/her meals elsewhere.  For more information, see SI 00835.140 - Separate Consumption
6.  Separate Purchase of Food
Separate purchase of food exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) physically shops for his/her own food or gives instructions and money to someone to buy the food for him/her.   Separate purchase of food can exist when an individual shops for his/ her own food but does not use his/her own money.   It may also apply even if the individual uses the same condiments or facilities (e.g., refrigerator, stove) as the rest of the household, or consumes meals at the same time as the rest of the household.  Separate purchase of food can also exist when an eligible spouse or a person whose income may be deemed to the individual buys food on behalf of the individual, but not necessarily only for the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.150 - Separate Purchase of Food for more information.
7.  Sharing
A sharing arrangement exists when an individual's contribution equals or exceeds his or her “pro rata” share of the household operating expenses, provided the household expenses include both food and shelter. Pro rata share is a term SSA uses to refer to an individual's share of the household operating expenses computed by dividing the household operating expenses by the number of persons permanently residing in the household. The pro rata share represents the dollar value of the individual's food and shelter received from within the household.  If the individual pays his/her pro rata share, he/she is not considered to be receiving any ISM from within the household. For additional information, refer to POMS SI 00835.160 - Sharing
8.  Earmarked Sharing
Earmarked sharing exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) designates part or all of his or her contribution toward household operating expenses for food or shelter and the contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of household expenses for food or shelter.  For example, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for shelter only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share for shelter, earmarked sharing exists.  Similarly, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for food only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of food expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of food expenses, earmarked sharing exists.
When an individual earmarks a specific portion of his contribution for food and another specific portion for shelter, it is called double earmarking. SSA computes the individual's pro rata share of food expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for food. Similarly, they compute the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for shelter. If either earmarked contribution equals or exceeds a pro rata share of the item for which it is earmarked (either food or shelter), earmarked sharing LA is determined.  See POMS SI 00835.170 - Earmarked Sharing for more information.
SSA gathers the information necessary to make LA determinations by interviewing the beneficiary and/or the representative payee or legal guardian.  The form SSA-8006-F4 is an interviewing and development tool which Claims Representatives often use for developing living arrangement (LA) and in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) issues. The answers to the questions on the SSA-8006-F4 document the individual's allegations regarding LA basis and cash income received from within and outside a household.
SSA may use an additional form (SSA-8011-F3) to verify things such as household operating expenses; the individual's contribution to household operating expenses, separate consumption, separate purchase of food, or earmarked contributions.  Samples of these forms are provided at the end of this document under the “Conducting Independent Research” section.
The LA decision is important because it determines which rule SSA uses to calculate the value of the ISM.  The value that is placed on the ISM is what affects the monthly SSI payment amount.  A detailed discussion of how the ISM valuation rules work is provided a bit later in this document.


Temporary Absences

Temporary absence is an individBasically, in-kind support and maintenance (also known as ISM) is unearned income attributable to an SSI eligible individual in the form of food or shelter that is given to the individual or received because someone else pays for it.  In-kind support may be provided by someone who lives in the same household as the recipient (such as a parent), or by someone outside of the household.

In-kind support and maintenance matters in the SSI program because SSI is intended to help pay for the basic costs of food and shelter.  If someone else is helping to pay for these things, then it stands to reason that the SSI would be reduced.  If too much ISM is received and other forms of income are in evidence, it may even cause a person to be found ineligible for SSI benefits.  For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:

•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);
•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and
•	the relationship between a sponsor and a legal alien.

In these situations, SSA determines that a certain amount of the responsible party’s income and/or resources are “deemed” available for the welfare of the SSI claimant or recipient.  SSA considers this “deemed” income and/or resources when someone first applies for SSI, and when figuring the SSI payment amount for individuals already found eligible.  For more information about deeming, refer to additional briefing papers posted to the WIPA NTC website at: http://www.vcu-ntc.org/resources/briefpapers.cfm
If income is deemed from the parent(s) to an eligible child, SSA will NOT also charge ISM from the parent(s) to that child.  However, if in-kind support and maintenance is being provided to the eligible child by some other party from outside of the household, SSA will charge that to the child in addition to any income deemed from the parent(s).
Keep in mind that once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA considers the person to be an adult.  From that point forward, parent-to-child deeming stops.  As of the 18th birthday, SSA no longer considers the income or resources of the parents when making eligibility determinations and calculating payment amount.  There are no exceptions to this rule, even if the parents have been appointed as the legal guardian of the young adult with the disability.  Parent-to-child deeming never applies to an SSI recipient who is 18 years of age or older.
While the parent’s income and resources are no longer relevant once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA continues to be concerned about whether the parents (or anyone else for that matter) are helping the individual pay for the costs of food and shelter.  After the 18th birthday has occurred and the individual has successfully established eligibility for SSI under the adult rules, SSA will look to see whether or not in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is in evidence.  For an SSI recipient aged 18 or older, ISM may be provided from within the household by the parent(s), from outside of the household by any other party, or even from both.
In situations in which spouse-to-spouse or sponsor-to-alien deeming is occurring, similar ISM rules apply.  It is possible for ISM to be simultaneously assessed in situations where deeming occurs if the in-kind support and maintenance is provided by someone other than the deemor.  SSA will not charge ISM if it is provided by someone living in the same household whose income is already subject to deeming to the individual.


Relationship between ISM and Living Arrangement

The first step in the process of determining if ISM is in evidence is to determine which living arrangement (LA) the individual is in.  How in-kind support and maintenance is viewed by SSA and the value that is placed upon it depends upon the living arrangement an individual is determined to be in.  SSA begins this process by collecting evidence about the individual’s living situation and deciding whether the person resides in a “household” or “non-household”.   Social Security has very specific definitions that they apply here which are described below.

Non-Household Living Arrangements

A non-household situation exists if the recipient is either a transient or a resident of an institution.  A transient is defined by SSA as someone with no permanent living arrangement, or no fixed place of residence. A transient can be a homeless individual (i.e., someone who sleeps in doorways, overnight shelters, parks, bus stations, etc.); or a person who stays with a succession of friends or relatives and has no permanent living arrangement.

Residing in an institution (as defined for SSI purposes) can affect an SSI recipient's eligibility and/or payment amount.  Residents of public institutions generally are ineligible for SSI.  The reasoning here is that some other government source is already paying for the individual’s food and shelter, thus, SSI is not needed.  Residents of medical facilities (public or private) may be eligible, but are limited to a maximum Federal payment of $30 a month. However, there are many exceptions to these generalizations. Individuals living in a public shelter for the homeless may only be eligible for SSI for up to 6 months in any 9 month period.  This is an exception to the standard rules which is intended to help homeless persons prepare for more permanent living arrangements.

Household Living Arrangements

A household situation exists when an individual is not a transient or a resident of an institution. It is important to remember that the SSI program defines “household” differently than the physical space in which the beneficiary resides.  For SSI purposes, living within someone else’s household actually means that “someone else” takes financial responsibility for the SSI beneficiary.  Living in one’s own household means that the beneficiary has financial responsibility for his or her own food and shelter--does not equate to living alone.  Here are two examples:
Carol lives with her mother, Adriana.   Carol and her mom pay all costs equally for food, rent, utilities and other basic expenses. Carol receives SSI as a disabled individual.   For the purposes of SSI, Carol is living in her own household.

Carol moves out to an expensive apartment complex.  A rich friend has decided to pay all of Carol’s expenses, including rent, food, utilities, etc.  For the purposes of Carol’s SSI benefit, she is living in the household of another—even though she is living alone.

For purposes of living arrangement determinations and ISM, members of a household do not have to be related by blood or marriage. A person who is temporarily absent from a household is still a member of the household under some very specific circumstances.  SSA applies very specific rules to temporary absences which will be covered a bit later in this document.

Developing Living Arrangements (LA)
The Social Security Administration follows a prescribed sequence in developing an individual’s living arrangement (LA) to ensure that the correct ISM valuation rule is used and that possible sources of ISM are not overlooked or developed unnecessarily. SSA develops the living arrangement only for a person’s permanent residence.  For the purposes of developing LA, a residence is defined as the location of abode or dwelling place. A residence is also a place where a person makes his/her home. In SSA parlance, “residence” is synonymous with the term “permanent living arrangement.”  Below is a brief description of the standard federal living arrangements.
1.  Noninstitutional Care

This situation exists when an individual is placed by a public or private agency under a specific program of protective placement such as foster or family care. To qualify as non-institutional care, the placement must be a private dwelling (not an institution or commercial establishment) which is licensed or otherwise approved by the State to provide foster or family care. The placing agency retains responsibility for continuing supervision of the need for such placement and of the services provided. The individual, the placing agency, or some other third party pays for the food, shelter, and protective supervision provided. (See POMS SI 00835.790 Noninstitutional Care Situations for more information).

2.  Home Ownership

SSA considers an individual to be living in his/her own household when any form of ownership interest in the home belongs to the individual; his/her living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.110 - Home Ownership as LA Basis for more information.
3.  Rental Liability
An individual is living in his own household when there is liability to the landlord for payment of any of the rental charges on the part of the individual; the living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual. Room rental within a private dwelling is also a form of rental liability. When an individual lives in the same dwelling with the landlord, he/ she must be in a separate household from the landlord's in order to have rental liability. A separate household functions as a separate economic unit, and more than one economic unit may exist in a single dwelling. If the individual and the landlord do not function as separate economic units, the individual is not considered to be in a separate household and cannot have rental liability. An arrangement in which a flat fee for room and board is charged would be another form of rental liability. It is a variation of separate room rental within a private dwelling. With a flat fee arrangement, the individual maintains a separate household from the landlord and pays a flat rate for food and shelter.  See POMS SI 00835.120 - Rental Liability as LA Basis for more information.
4.  Public Assistance (PA) Households
A public assistance household is one in which every member receives some kind of public income maintenance payments (which this section refers to as “PA payments”). These are payments made under:
•	Title IV-A of the Social Security Act - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
•	Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI, including federally administered State supplements and State administered mandatory supplements);
•	The Refugee Act of 1980 (those payments based on need)
•	Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
•	General assistance programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
•	State or local government assistance programs based on need (tax credits or refunds are not assistance based on need), and
•	Department of Veterans Affairs programs (those payments based on need)
See POMS SI 00835.130 - Public Assistance Households for more information.
5.  Separate Consumption
Separate consumption means that an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) is taking all meals outside of the household in which he resides and is not reimbursed by the householder.  For separate consumption LA to apply, the individual must consume all of his/her meals elsewhere.  For more information, see SI 00835.140 - Separate Consumption
6.  Separate Purchase of Food
Separate purchase of food exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) physically shops for his/her own food or gives instructions and money to someone to buy the food for him/her.   Separate purchase of food can exist when an individual shops for his/ her own food but does not use his/her own money.   It may also apply even if the individual uses the same condiments or facilities (e.g., refrigerator, stove) as the rest of the household, or consumes meals at the same time as the rest of the household.  Separate purchase of food can also exist when an eligible spouse or a person whose income may be deemed to the individual buys food on behalf of the individual, but not necessarily only for the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.150 - Separate Purchase of Food for more information.
7.  Sharing
A sharing arrangement exists when an individual's contribution equals or exceeds his or her “pro rata” share of the household operating expenses, provided the household expenses include both food and shelter. Pro rata share is a term SSA uses to refer to an individual's share of the household operating expenses computed by dividing the household operating expenses by the number of persons permanently residing in the household. The pro rata share represents the dollar value of the individual's food and shelter received from within the household.  If the individual pays his/her pro rata share, he/she is not considered to be receiving any ISM from within the household. For additional information, refer to POMS SI 00835.160 - Sharing
8.  Earmarked Sharing
Earmarked sharing exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) designates part or all of his or her contribution toward household operating expenses for food or shelter and the contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of household expenses for food or shelter.  For example, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for shelter only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share for shelter, earmarked sharing exists.  Similarly, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for food only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of food expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of food expenses, earmarked sharing exists.
When an individual earmarks a specific portion of his contribution for food and another specific portion for shelter, it is called double earmarking. SSA computes the individual's pro rata share of food expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for food. Similarly, they compute the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for shelter. If either earmarked contribution equals or exceeds a pro rata share of the item for which it is earmarked (either food or shelter), earmarked sharing LA is determined.  See POMS SI 00835.170 - Earmarked Sharing for more information.
SSA gathers the information necessary to make LA determinations by interviewing the beneficiary and/or the representative payee or legal guardian.  The form SSA-8006-F4 is an interviewing and development tool which Claims Representatives often use for developing living arrangement (LA) and in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) issues. The answers to the questions on the SSA-8006-F4 document the individual's allegations regarding LA basis and cash income received from within and outside a household.
SSA may use an additional form (SSA-8011-F3) to verify things such as household operating expenses; the individual's contribution to household operating expenses, separate consumption, separate purchase of food, or earmarked contributions.  Samples of these forms are provided at the end of this document under the “Conducting Independent Research” section.
The LA decision is important because it determines which rule SSA uses to calculate the value of the ISM.  The value that is placed on the ISM is what affects the monthly SSI payment amount.  A detailed discussion of how the ISM valuation rules work is provided a bit later in this document.


Temporary Absences

Temporary absence is an individBasically, in-kind support and maintenance (also known as ISM) is unearned income attributable to an SSI eligible individual in the form of food or shelter that is given to the individual or received because someone else pays for it.  In-kind support may be provided by someone who lives in the same household as the recipient (such as a parent), or by someone outside of the household.

In-kind support and maintenance matters in the SSI program because SSI is intended to help pay for the basic costs of food and shelter.  If someone else is helping to pay for these things, then it stands to reason that the SSI would be reduced.  If too much ISM is received and other forms of income are in evidence, it may even cause a person to be found ineligible for SSI benefits.  For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);
•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);
•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and
•	the relationship between a sponsor and a legal alien.

In these situations, SSA determines that a certain amount of the responsible party’s income and/or resources are “deemed” available for the welfare of the SSI claimant or recipient.  SSA considers this “deemed” income and/or resources when someone first applies for SSI, and when figuring the SSI payment amount for individuals already found eligible.  For more information about deeming, refer to additional briefing papers posted to the WIPA NTC website at: http://www.vcu-ntc.org/resources/briefpapers.cfm
If income is deemed from the parent(s) to an eligible child, SSA will NOT also charge ISM from the parent(s) to that child.  However, if in-kind support and maintenance is being provided to the eligible child by some other party from outside of the household, SSA will charge that to the child in addition to any income deemed from the parent(s).
Keep in mind that once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA considers the person to be an adult.  From that point forward, parent-to-child deeming stops.  As of the 18th birthday, SSA no longer considers the income or resources of the parents when making eligibility determinations and calculating payment amount.  There are no exceptions to this rule, even if the parents have been appointed as the legal guardian of the young adult with the disability.  Parent-to-child deeming never applies to an SSI recipient who is 18 years of age or older.
While the parent’s income and resources are no longer relevant once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA continues to be concerned about whether the parents (or anyone else for that matter) are helping the individual pay for the costs of food and shelter.  After the 18th birthday has occurred and the individual has successfully established eligibility for SSI under the adult rules, SSA will look to see whether or not in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is in evidence.  For an SSI recipient aged 18 or older, ISM may be provided from within the household by the parent(s), from outside of the household by any other party, or even from both.
In situations in which spouse-to-spouse or sponsor-to-alien deeming is occurring, similar ISM rules apply.  It is possible for ISM to be simultaneously assessed in situations where deeming occurs if the in-kind support and maintenance is provided by someone other than the deemor.  SSA will not charge ISM if it is provided by someone living in the same household whose income is already subject to deeming to the individual.


Relationship between ISM and Living Arrangement

The first step in the process of determining if ISM is in evidence is to determine which living arrangement (LA) the individual is in.  How in-kind support and maintenance is viewed by SSA and the value that is placed upon it depends upon the living arrangement an individual is determined to be in.  SSA begins this process by collecting evidence about the individual’s living situation and deciding whether the person resides in a “household” or “non-household”.   Social Security has very specific definitions that they apply here which are described below.

Non-Household Living Arrangements

A non-household situation exists if the recipient is either a transient or a resident of an institution.  A transient is defined by SSA as someone with no permanent living arrangement, or no fixed place of residence. A transient can be a homeless individual (i.e., someone who sleeps in doorways, overnight shelters, parks, bus stations, etc.); or a person who stays with a succession of friends or relatives and has no permanent living arrangement.

Residing in an institution (as defined for SSI purposes) can affect an SSI recipient's eligibility and/or payment amount.  Residents of public institutions generally are ineligible for SSI.  The reasoning here is that some other government source is already paying for the individual’s food and shelter, thus, SSI is not needed.  Residents of medical facilities (public or private) may be eligible, but are limited to a maximum Federal payment of $30 a month. However, there are many exceptions to these generalizations. Individuals living in a public shelter for the homeless may only be eligible for SSI for up to 6 months in any 9 month period.  This is an exception to the standard rules which is intended to help homeless persons prepare for more permanent living arrangements.

Household Living Arrangements

A household situation exists when an individual is not a transient or a resident of an institution. It is important to remember that the SSI program defines “household” differently than the physical space in which the beneficiary resides.  For SSI purposes, living within someone else’s household actually means that “someone else” takes financial responsibility for the SSI beneficiary.  Living in one’s own household means that the beneficiary has financial responsibility for his or her own food and shelter--does not equate to living alone.  Here are two examples:
Carol lives with her mother, Adriana.   Carol and her mom pay all costs equally for food, rent, utilities and other basic expenses. Carol receives SSI as a disabled individual.   For the purposes of SSI, Carol is living in her own household.

Carol moves out to an expensive apartment complex.  A rich friend has decided to pay all of Carol’s expenses, including rent, food, utilities, etc.  For the purposes of Carol’s SSI benefit, she is living in the household of another—even though she is living alone.

For purposes of living arrangement determinations and ISM, members of a household do not have to be related by blood or marriage. A person who is temporarily absent from a household is still a member of the household under some very specific circumstances.  SSA applies very specific rules to temporary absences which will be covered a bit later in this document.

Developing Living Arrangements (LA)
The Social Security Administration follows a prescribed sequence in developing an individual’s living arrangement (LA) to ensure that the correct ISM valuation rule is used and that possible sources of ISM are not overlooked or developed unnecessarily. SSA develops the living arrangement only for a person’s permanent residence.  For the purposes of developing LA, a residence is defined as the location of abode or dwelling place. A residence is also a place where a person makes his/her home. In SSA parlance, “residence” is synonymous with the term “permanent living arrangement.”  Below is a brief description of the standard federal living arrangements.
1.  Noninstitutional Care

This situation exists when an individual is placed by a public or private agency under a specific program of protective placement such as foster or family care. To qualify as non-institutional care, the placement must be a private dwelling (not an institution or commercial establishment) which is licensed or otherwise approved by the State to provide foster or family care. The placing agency retains responsibility for continuing supervision of the need for such placement and of the services provided. The individual, the placing agency, or some other third party pays for the food, shelter, and protective supervision provided. (See POMS SI 00835.790 Noninstitutional Care Situations for more information).

2.  Home Ownership

SSA considers an individual to be living in his/her own household when any form of ownership interest in the home belongs to the individual; his/her living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.110 - Home Ownership as LA Basis for more information.
3.  Rental Liability
An individual is living in his own household when there is liability to the landlord for payment of any of the rental charges on the part of the individual; the living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual. Room rental within a private dwelling is also a form of rental liability. When an individual lives in the same dwelling with the landlord, he/ she must be in a separate household from the landlord's in order to have rental liability. A separate household functions as a separate economic unit, and more than one economic unit may exist in a single dwelling. If the individual and the landlord do not function as separate economic units, the individual is not considered to be in a separate household and cannot have rental liability. An arrangement in which a flat fee for room and board is charged would be another form of rental liability. It is a variation of separate room rental within a private dwelling. With a flat fee arrangement, the individual maintains a separate household from the landlord and pays a flat rate for food and shelter.  See POMS SI 00835.120 - Rental Liability as LA Basis for more information.
4.  Public Assistance (PA) Households
A public assistance household is one in which every member receives some kind of public income maintenance payments (which this section refers to as “PA payments”). These are payments made under:
•	Title IV-A of the Social Security Act - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
•	Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI, including federally administered State supplements and State administered mandatory supplements);
•	The Refugee Act of 1980 (those payments based on need)
•	Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
•	General assistance programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
•	State or local government assistance programs based on need (tax credits or refunds are not assistance based on need), and
•	Department of Veterans Affairs programs (those payments based on need)
See POMS SI 00835.130 - Public Assistance Households for more information.
5.  Separate Consumption
Separate consumption means that an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) is taking all meals outside of the household in which he resides and is not reimbursed by the householder.  For separate consumption LA to apply, the individual must consume all of his/her meals elsewhere.  For more information, see SI 00835.140 - Separate Consumption
6.  Separate Purchase of Food
Separate purchase of food exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) physically shops for his/her own food or gives instructions and money to someone to buy the food for him/her.   Separate purchase of food can exist when an individual shops for his/ her own food but does not use his/her own money.   It may also apply even if the individual uses the same condiments or facilities (e.g., refrigerator, stove) as the rest of the household, or consumes meals at the same time as the rest of the household.  Separate purchase of food can also exist when an eligible spouse or a person whose income may be deemed to the individual buys food on behalf of the individual, but not necessarily only for the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.150 - Separate Purchase of Food for more information.
7.  Sharing
A sharing arrangement exists when an individual's contribution equals or exceeds his or her “pro rata” share of the household operating expenses, provided the household expenses include both food and shelter. Pro rata share is a term SSA uses to refer to an individual's share of the household operating expenses computed by dividing the household operating expenses by the number of persons permanently residing in the household. The pro rata share represents the dollar value of the individual's food and shelter received from within the household.  If the individual pays his/her pro rata share, he/she is not considered to be receiving any ISM from within the household. For additional information, refer to POMS SI 00835.160 - Sharing
8.  Earmarked Sharing
Earmarked sharing exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) designates part or all of his or her contribution toward household operating expenses for food or shelter and the contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of household expenses for food or shelter.  For example, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for shelter only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share for shelter, earmarked sharing exists.  Similarly, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for food only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of food expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of food expenses, earmarked sharing exists.
When an individual earmarks a specific portion of his contribution for food and another specific portion for shelter, it is called double earmarking. SSA computes the individual's pro rata share of food expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for food. Similarly, they compute the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for shelter. If either earmarked contribution equals or exceeds a pro rata share of the item for which it is earmarked (either food or shelter), earmarked sharing LA is determined.  See POMS SI 00835.170 - Earmarked Sharing for more information.
SSA gathers the information necessary to make LA determinations by interviewing the beneficiary and/or the representative payee or legal guardian.  The form SSA-8006-F4 is an interviewing and development tool which Claims Representatives often use for developing living arrangement (LA) and in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) issues. The answers to the questions on the SSA-8006-F4 document the individual's allegations regarding LA basis and cash income received from within and outside a household.
SSA may use an additional form (SSA-8011-F3) to verify things such as household operating expenses; the individual's contribution to household operating expenses, separate consumption, separate purchase of food, or earmarked contributions.  Samples of these forms are provided at the end of this document under the “Conducting Independent Research” section.
The LA decision is important because it determines which rule SSA uses to calculate the value of the ISM.  The value that is placed on the ISM is what affects the monthly SSI payment amount.  A detailed discussion of how the ISM valuation rules work is provided a bit later in this document.


Temporary Absences

Temporary absence is an individBasically, in-kind support and maintenance (also known as ISM) is unearned income attributable to an SSI eligible individual in the form of food or shelter that is given to the individual or received because someone else pays for it.  In-kind support may be provided by someone who lives in the same household as the recipient (such as a parent), or by someone outside of the household.

In-kind support and maintenance matters in the SSI program because SSI is intended to help pay for the basic costs of food and shelter.  If someone else is helping to pay for these things, then it stands to reason that the SSI would be reduced.  If too much ISM is received and other forms of income are in evidence, it may even cause a person to be found ineligible for SSI benefits.  For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);
•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and
•	the relationship between a sponsor and a legal alien.

•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and
•	the relationship between a sponsor and a legal alien.

In these situations, SSA determines that a certain amount of the responsible party’s income and/or resources are “deemed” available for the welfare of the SSI claimant or recipient.  SSA considers this “deemed” income and/or resources when someone first applies for SSI, and when figuring the SSI payment amount for individuals already found eligible.  For more information about deeming, refer to additional briefing papers posted to the WIPA NTC website at: http://www.vcu-ntc.org/resources/briefpapers.cfm
If income is deemed from the parent(s) to an eligible child, SSA will NOT also charge ISM from the parent(s) to that child.  However, if in-kind support and maintenance is being provided to the eligible child by some other party from outside of the household, SSA will charge that to the child in addition to any income deemed from the parent(s).
Keep in mind that once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA considers the person to be an adult.  From that point forward, parent-to-child deeming stops.  As of the 18th birthday, SSA no longer considers the income or resources of the parents when making eligibility determinations and calculating payment amount.  There are no exceptions to this rule, even if the parents have been appointed as the legal guardian of the young adult with the disability.  Parent-to-child deeming never applies to an SSI recipient who is 18 years of age or older.
While the parent’s income and resources are no longer relevant once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA continues to be concerned about whether the parents (or anyone else for that matter) are helping the individual pay for the costs of food and shelter.  After the 18th birthday has occurred and the individual has successfully established eligibility for SSI under the adult rules, SSA will look to see whether or not in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is in evidence.  For an SSI recipient aged 18 or older, ISM may be provided from within the household by the parent(s), from outside of the household by any other party, or even from both.
In situations in which spouse-to-spouse or sponsor-to-alien deeming is occurring, similar ISM rules apply.  It is possible for ISM to be simultaneously assessed in situations where deeming occurs if the in-kind support and maintenance is provided by someone other than the deemor.  SSA will not charge ISM if it is provided by someone living in the same household whose income is already subject to deeming to the individual.


Relationship between ISM and Living Arrangement

The first step in the process of determining if ISM is in evidence is to determine which living arrangement (LA) the individual is in.  How in-kind support and maintenance is viewed by SSA and the value that is placed upon it depends upon the living arrangement an individual is determined to be in.  SSA begins this process by collecting evidence about the individual’s living situation and deciding whether the person resides in a “household” or “non-household”.   Social Security has very specific definitions that they apply here which are described below.

Non-Household Living Arrangements

A non-household situation exists if the recipient is either a transient or a resident of an institution.  A transient is defined by SSA as someone with no permanent living arrangement, or no fixed place of residence. A transient can be a homeless individual (i.e., someone who sleeps in doorways, overnight shelters, parks, bus stations, etc.); or a person who stays with a succession of friends or relatives and has no permanent living arrangement.

Residing in an institution (as defined for SSI purposes) can affect an SSI recipient's eligibility and/or payment amount.  Residents of public institutions generally are ineligible for SSI.  The reasoning here is that some other government source is already paying for the individual’s food and shelter, thus, SSI is not needed.  Residents of medical facilities (public or private) may be eligible, but are limited to a maximum Federal payment of $30 a month. However, there are many exceptions to these generalizations. Individuals living in a public shelter for the homeless may only be eligible for SSI for up to 6 months in any 9 month period.  This is an exception to the standard rules which is intended to help homeless persons prepare for more permanent living arrangements.

Household Living Arrangements

A household situation exists when an individual is not a transient or a resident of an institution. It is important to remember that the SSI program defines “household” differently than the physical space in which the beneficiary resides.  For SSI purposes, living within someone else’s household actually means that “someone else” takes financial responsibility for the SSI beneficiary.  Living in one’s own household means that the beneficiary has financial responsibility for his or her own food and shelter--does not equate to living alone.  Here are two examples:
Carol lives with her mother, Adriana.   Carol and her mom pay all costs equally for food, rent, utilities and other basic expenses. Carol receives SSI as a disabled individual.   For the purposes of SSI, Carol is living in her own household.

Carol moves out to an expensive apartment complex.  A rich friend has decided to pay all of Carol’s expenses, including rent, food, utilities, etc.  For the purposes of Carol’s SSI benefit, she is living in the household of another—even though she is living alone.

For purposes of living arrangement determinations and ISM, members of a household do not have to be related by blood or marriage. A person who is temporarily absent from a household is still a member of the household under some very specific circumstances.  SSA applies very specific rules to temporary absences which will be covered a bit later in this document.

Developing Living Arrangements (LA)
The Social Security Administration follows a prescribed sequence in developing an individual’s living arrangement (LA) to ensure that the correct ISM valuation rule is used and that possible sources of ISM are not overlooked or developed unnecessarily. SSA develops the living arrangement only for a person’s permanent residence.  For the purposes of developing LA, a residence is defined as the location of abode or dwelling place. A residence is also a place where a person makes his/her home. In SSA parlance, “residence” is synonymous with the term “permanent living arrangement.”  Below is a brief description of the standard federal living arrangements.
1.  Noninstitutional Care

This situation exists when an individual is placed by a public or private agency under a specific program of protective placement such as foster or family care. To qualify as non-institutional care, the placement must be a private dwelling (not an institution or commercial establishment) which is licensed or otherwise approved by the State to provide foster or family care. The placing agency retains responsibility for continuing supervision of the need for such placement and of the services provided. The individual, the placing agency, or some other third party pays for the food, shelter, and protective supervision provided. (See POMS SI 00835.790 Noninstitutional Care Situations for more information).

2.  Home Ownership

SSA considers an individual to be living in his/her own household when any form of ownership interest in the home belongs to the individual; his/her living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.110 - Home Ownership as LA Basis for more information.
3.  Rental Liability
An individual is living in his own household when there is liability to the landlord for payment of any of the rental charges on the part of the individual; the living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual. Room rental within a private dwelling is also a form of rental liability. When an individual lives in the same dwelling with the landlord, he/ she must be in a separate household from the landlord's in order to have rental liability. A separate household functions as a separate economic unit, and more than one economic unit may exist in a single dwelling. If the individual and the landlord do not function as separate economic units, the individual is not considered to be in a separate household and cannot have rental liability. An arrangement in which a flat fee for room and board is charged would be another form of rental liability. It is a variation of separate room rental within a private dwelling. With a flat fee arrangement, the individual maintains a separate household from the landlord and pays a flat rate for food and shelter.  See POMS SI 00835.120 - Rental Liability as LA Basis for more information.
4.  Public Assistance (PA) Households
A public assistance household is one in which every member receives some kind of public income maintenance payments (which this section refers to as “PA payments”). These are payments made under:
•	Title IV-A of the Social Security Act - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
•	Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI, including federally administered State supplements and State administered mandatory supplements);
•	The Refugee Act of 1980 (those payments based on need)
•	Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
•	General assistance programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
•	State or local government assistance programs based on need (tax credits or refunds are not assistance based on need), and
•	Department of Veterans Affairs programs (those payments based on need)
See POMS SI 00835.130 - Public Assistance Households for more information.
5.  Separate Consumption
Separate consumption means that an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) is taking all meals outside of the household in which he resides and is not reimbursed by the householder.  For separate consumption LA to apply, the individual must consume all of his/her meals elsewhere.  For more information, see SI 00835.140 - Separate Consumption
6.  Separate Purchase of Food
Separate purchase of food exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) physically shops for his/her own food or gives instructions and money to someone to buy the food for him/her.   Separate purchase of food can exist when an individual shops for his/ her own food but does not use his/her own money.   It may also apply even if the individual uses the same condiments or facilities (e.g., refrigerator, stove) as the rest of the household, or consumes meals at the same time as the rest of the household.  Separate purchase of food can also exist when an eligible spouse or a person whose income may be deemed to the individual buys food on behalf of the individual, but not necessarily only for the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.150 - Separate Purchase of Food for more information.
7.  Sharing
A sharing arrangement exists when an individual's contribution equals or exceeds his or her “pro rata” share of the household operating expenses, provided the household expenses include both food and shelter. Pro rata share is a term SSA uses to refer to an individual's share of the household operating expenses computed by dividing the household operating expenses by the number of persons permanently residing in the household. The pro rata share represents the dollar value of the individual's food and shelter received from within the household.  If the individual pays his/her pro rata share, he/she is not considered to be receiving any ISM from within the household. For additional information, refer to POMS SI 00835.160 - Sharing
8.  Earmarked Sharing
Earmarked sharing exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) designates part or all of his or her contribution toward household operating expenses for food or shelter and the contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of household expenses for food or shelter.  For example, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for shelter only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share for shelter, earmarked sharing exists.  Similarly, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for food only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of food expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of food expenses, earmarked sharing exists.
When an individual earmarks a specific portion of his contribution for food and another specific portion for shelter, it is called double earmarking. SSA computes the individual's pro rata share of food expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for food. Similarly, they compute the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for shelter. If either earmarked contribution equals or exceeds a pro rata share of the item for which it is earmarked (either food or shelter), earmarked sharing LA is determined.  See POMS SI 00835.170 - Earmarked Sharing for more information.
SSA gathers the information necessary to make LA determinations by interviewing the beneficiary and/or the representative payee or legal guardian.  The form SSA-8006-F4 is an interviewing and development tool which Claims Representatives often use for developing living arrangement (LA) and in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) issues. The answers to the questions on the SSA-8006-F4 document the individual's allegations regarding LA basis and cash income received from within and outside a household.
SSA may use an additional form (SSA-8011-F3) to verify things such as household operating expenses; the individual's contribution to household operating expenses, separate consumption, separate purchase of food, or earmarked contributions.  Samples of these forms are provided at the end of this document under the “Conducting Independent Research” section.
The LA decision is important because it determines which rule SSA uses to calculate the value of the ISM.  The value that is placed on the ISM is what affects the monthly SSI payment amount.  A detailed discussion of how the ISM valuation rules work is provided a bit later in this document.


Temporary Absences

Temporary absence is an individBasically, in-kind support and maintenance (also known as ISM) is unearned income attributable to an SSI eligible individual in the form of food or shelter that is given to the individual or received because someone else pays for it.  In-kind support may be provided by someone who lives in the same household as the recipient (such as a parent), or by someone outside of the household.

In-kind support and maintenance matters in the SSI program because SSI is intended to help pay for the basic costs of food and shelter.  If someone else is helping to pay for these things, then it stands to reason that the SSI would be reduced.  If too much ISM is received and other forms of income are in evidence, it may even cause a person to be found ineligible for SSI benefits.  For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);
•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and
•	the relationship between a sponsor and a legal alien.

In these situations, SSA determines that a certain amount of the responsible party’s income and/or resources are “deemed” available for the welfare of the SSI claimant or recipient.  SSA considers this “deemed” income and/or resources when someone first applies for SSI, and when figuring the SSI payment amount for individuals already found eligible.  For more information about deeming, refer to additional briefing papers posted to the WIPA NTC website at: http://www.vcu-ntc.org/resources/briefpapers.cfm
If income is deemed from the parent(s) to an eligible child, SSA will NOT also charge ISM from the parent(s) to that child.  However, if in-kind support and maintenance is being provided to the eligible child by some other party from outside of the household, SSA will charge that to the child in addition to any income deemed from the parent(s).
Keep in mind that once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA considers the person to be an adult.  From that point forward, parent-to-child deeming stops.  As of the 18th birthday, SSA no longer considers the income or resources of the parents when making eligibility determinations and calculating payment amount.  There are no exceptions to this rule, even if the parents have been appointed as the legal guardian of the young adult with the disability.  Parent-to-child deeming never applies to an SSI recipient who is 18 years of age or older.
While the parent’s income and resources are no longer relevant once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA continues to be concerned about whether the parents (or anyone else for that matter) are helping the individual pay for the costs of food and shelter.  After the 18th birthday has occurred and the individual has successfully established eligibility for SSI under the adult rules, SSA will look to see whether or not in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is in evidence.  For an SSI recipient aged 18 or older, ISM may be provided from within the household by the parent(s), from outside of the household by any other party, or even from both.
In situations in which spouse-to-spouse or sponsor-to-alien deeming is occurring, similar ISM rules apply.  It is possible for ISM to be simultaneously assessed in situations where deeming occurs if the in-kind support and maintenance is provided by someone other than the deemor.  SSA will not charge ISM if it is provided by someone living in the same household whose income is already subject to deeming to the individual.


Relationship between ISM and Living Arrangement

The first step in the process of determining if ISM is in evidence is to determine which living arrangement (LA) the individual is in.  How in-kind support and maintenance is viewed by SSA and the value that is placed upon it depends upon the living arrangement an individual is determined to be in.  SSA begins this process by collecting evidence about the individual’s living situation and deciding whether the person resides in a “household” or “non-household”.   Social Security has very specific definitions that they apply here which are described below.

Non-Household Living Arrangements

A non-household situation exists if the recipient is either a transient or a resident of an institution.  A transient is defined by SSA as someone with no permanent living arrangement, or no fixed place of residence. A transient can be a homeless individual (i.e., someone who sleeps in doorways, overnight shelters, parks, bus stations, etc.); or a person who stays with a succession of friends or relatives and has no permanent living arrangement.

Residing in an institution (as defined for SSI purposes) can affect an SSI recipient's eligibility and/or payment amount.  Residents of public institutions generally are ineligible for SSI.  The reasoning here is that some other government source is already paying for the individual’s food and shelter, thus, SSI is not needed.  Residents of medical facilities (public or private) may be eligible, but are limited to a maximum Federal payment of $30 a month. However, there are many exceptions to these generalizations. Individuals living in a public shelter for the homeless may only be eligible for SSI for up to 6 months in any 9 month period.  This is an exception to the standard rules which is intended to help homeless persons prepare for more permanent living arrangements.

Household Living Arrangements

A household situation exists when an individual is not a transient or a resident of an institution. It is important to remember that the SSI program defines “household” differently than the physical space in which the beneficiary resides.  For SSI purposes, living within someone else’s household actually means that “someone else” takes financial responsibility for the SSI beneficiary.  Living in one’s own household means that the beneficiary has financial responsibility for his or her own food and shelter--does not equate to living alone.  Here are two examples:
Carol lives with her mother, Adriana.   Carol and her mom pay all costs equally for food, rent, utilities and other basic expenses. Carol receives SSI as a disabled individual.   For the purposes of SSI, Carol is living in her own household.

Carol moves out to an expensive apartment complex.  A rich friend has decided to pay all of Carol’s expenses, including rent, food, utilities, etc.  For the purposes of Carol’s SSI benefit, she is living in the household of another—even though she is living alone.

For purposes of living arrangement determinations and ISM, members of a household do not have to be related by blood or marriage. A person who is temporarily absent from a household is still a member of the household under some very specific circumstances.  SSA applies very specific rules to temporary absences which will be covered a bit later in this document.

Developing Living Arrangements (LA)
The Social Security Administration follows a prescribed sequence in developing an individual’s living arrangement (LA) to ensure that the correct ISM valuation rule is used and that possible sources of ISM are not overlooked or developed unnecessarily. SSA develops the living arrangement only for a person’s permanent residence.  For the purposes of developing LA, a residence is defined as the location of abode or dwelling place. A residence is also a place where a person makes his/her home. In SSA parlance, “residence” is synonymous with the term “permanent living arrangement.”  Below is a brief description of the standard federal living arrangements.
1.  Noninstitutional Care

This situation exists when an individual is placed by a public or private agency under a specific program of protective placement such as foster or family care. To qualify as non-institutional care, the placement must be a private dwelling (not an institution or commercial establishment) which is licensed or otherwise approved by the State to provide foster or family care. The placing agency retains responsibility for continuing supervision of the need for such placement and of the services provided. The individual, the placing agency, or some other third party pays for the food, shelter, and protective supervision provided. (See POMS SI 00835.790 Noninstitutional Care Situations for more information).

2.  Home Ownership

SSA considers an individual to be living in his/her own household when any form of ownership interest in the home belongs to the individual; his/her living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.110 - Home Ownership as LA Basis for more information.
3.  Rental Liability
An individual is living in his own household when there is liability to the landlord for payment of any of the rental charges on the part of the individual; the living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual. Room rental within a private dwelling is also a form of rental liability. When an individual lives in the same dwelling with the landlord, he/ she must be in a separate household from the landlord's in order to have rental liability. A separate household functions as a separate economic unit, and more than one economic unit may exist in a single dwelling. If the individual and the landlord do not function as separate economic units, the individual is not considered to be in a separate household and cannot have rental liability. An arrangement in which a flat fee for room and board is charged would be another form of rental liability. It is a variation of separate room rental within a private dwelling. With a flat fee arrangement, the individual maintains a separate household from the landlord and pays a flat rate for food and shelter.  See POMS SI 00835.120 - Rental Liability as LA Basis for more information.
4.  Public Assistance (PA) Households
A public assistance household is one in which every member receives some kind of public income maintenance payments (which this section refers to as “PA payments”). These are payments made under:
•	Title IV-A of the Social Security Act - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
•	Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI, including federally administered State supplements and State administered mandatory supplements);
•	The Refugee Act of 1980 (those payments based on need)
•	Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
•	General assistance programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
•	State or local government assistance programs based on need (tax credits or refunds are not assistance based on need), and
•	Department of Veterans Affairs programs (those payments based on need)
See POMS SI 00835.130 - Public Assistance Households for more information.
5.  Separate Consumption
Separate consumption means that an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) is taking all meals outside of the household in which he resides and is not reimbursed by the householder.  For separate consumption LA to apply, the individual must consume all of his/her meals elsewhere.  For more information, see SI 00835.140 - Separate Consumption
6.  Separate Purchase of Food
Separate purchase of food exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) physically shops for his/her own food or gives instructions and money to someone to buy the food for him/her.   Separate purchase of food can exist when an individual shops for his/ her own food but does not use his/her own money.   It may also apply even if the individual uses the same condiments or facilities (e.g., refrigerator, stove) as the rest of the household, or consumes meals at the same time as the rest of the household.  Separate purchase of food can also exist when an eligible spouse or a person whose income may be deemed to the individual buys food on behalf of the individual, but not necessarily only for the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.150 - Separate Purchase of Food for more information.
7.  Sharing
A sharing arrangement exists when an individual's contribution equals or exceeds his or her “pro rata” share of the household operating expenses, provided the household expenses include both food and shelter. Pro rata share is a term SSA uses to refer to an individual's share of the household operating expenses computed by dividing the household operating expenses by the number of persons permanently residing in the household. The pro rata share represents the dollar value of the individual's food and shelter received from within the household.  If the individual pays his/her pro rata share, he/she is not considered to be receiving any ISM from within the household. For additional information, refer to POMS SI 00835.160 - Sharing
8.  Earmarked Sharing
Earmarked sharing exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) designates part or all of his or her contribution toward household operating expenses for food or shelter and the contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of household expenses for food or shelter.  For example, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for shelter only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share for shelter, earmarked sharing exists.  Similarly, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for food only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of food expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of food expenses, earmarked sharing exists.
When an individual earmarks a specific portion of his contribution for food and another specific portion for shelter, it is called double earmarking. SSA computes the individual's pro rata share of food expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for food. Similarly, they compute the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for shelter. If either earmarked contribution equals or exceeds a pro rata share of the item for which it is earmarked (either food or shelter), earmarked sharing LA is determined.  See POMS SI 00835.170 - Earmarked Sharing for more information.
SSA gathers the information necessary to make LA determinations by interviewing the beneficiary and/or the representative payee or legal guardian.  The form SSA-8006-F4 is an interviewing and development tool which Claims Representatives often use for developing living arrangement (LA) and in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) issues. The answers to the questions on the SSA-8006-F4 document the individual's allegations regarding LA basis and cash income received from within and outside a household.
SSA may use an additional form (SSA-8011-F3) to verify things such as household operating expenses; the individual's contribution to household operating expenses, separate consumption, separate purchase of food, or earmarked contributions.  Samples of these forms are provided at the end of this document under the “Conducting Independent Research” section.
The LA decision is important because it determines which rule SSA uses to calculate the value of the ISM.  The value that is placed on the ISM is what affects the monthly SSI payment amount.  A detailed discussion of how the ISM valuation rules work is provided a bit later in this document.


Temporary Absences

Temporary absence is an individBasically, in-kind support and maintenance (also known as ISM) is unearned income attributable to an SSI eligible individual in the form of food or shelter that is given to the individual or received because someone else pays for it.  In-kind support may be provided by someone who lives in the same household as the recipient (such as a parent), or by someone outside of the household.

In-kind support and maintenance matters in the SSI program because SSI is intended to help pay for the basic costs of food and shelter.  If someone else is helping to pay for these things, then it stands to reason that the SSI would be reduced.  If too much ISM is received and other forms of income are in evidence, it may even cause a person to be found ineligible for SSI benefits.  For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);
•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and
•	the relationship between a sponsor and a legal alien.

In these situations, SSA determines that a certain amount of the responsible party’s income and/or resources are “deemed” available for the welfare of the SSI claimant or recipient.  SSA considers this “deemed” income and/or resources when someone first applies for SSI, and when figuring the SSI payment amount for individuals already found eligible.  For more information about deeming, refer to additional briefing papers posted to the WIPA NTC website at: http://www.vcu-ntc.org/resources/briefpapers.cfm
If income is deemed from the parent(s) to an eligible child, SSA will NOT also charge ISM from the parent(s) to that child.  However, if in-kind support and maintenance is being provided to the eligible child by some other party from outside of the household, SSA will charge that to the child in addition to any income deemed from the parent(s).
Keep in mind that once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA considers the person to be an adult.  From that point forward, parent-to-child deeming stops.  As of the 18th birthday, SSA no longer considers the income or resources of the parents when making eligibility determinations and calculating payment amount.  There are no exceptions to this rule, even if the parents have been appointed as the legal guardian of the young adult with the disability.  Parent-to-child deeming never applies to an SSI recipient who is 18 years of age or older.
While the parent’s income and resources are no longer relevant once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA continues to be concerned about whether the parents (or anyone else for that matter) are helping the individual pay for the costs of food and shelter.  After the 18th birthday has occurred and the individual has successfully established eligibility for SSI under the adult rules, SSA will look to see whether or not in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is in evidence.  For an SSI recipient aged 18 or older, ISM may be provided from within the household by the parent(s), from outside of the household by any other party, or even from both.
In situations in which spouse-to-spouse or sponsor-to-alien deeming is occurring, similar ISM rules apply.  It is possible for ISM to be simultaneously assessed in situations where deeming occurs if the in-kind support and maintenance is provided by someone other than the deemor.  SSA will not charge ISM if it is provided by someone living in the same household whose income is already subject to deeming to the individual.


Relationship between ISM and Living Arrangement

The first step in the process of determining if ISM is in evidence is to determine which living arrangement (LA) the individual is in.  How in-kind support and maintenance is viewed by SSA and the value that is placed upon it depends upon the living arrangement an individual is determined to be in.  SSA begins this process by collecting evidence about the individual’s living situation and deciding whether the person resides in a “household” or “non-household”.   Social Security has very specific definitions that they apply here which are described below.

Non-Household Living Arrangements

A non-household situation exists if the recipient is either a transient or a resident of an institution.  A transient is defined by SSA as someone with no permanent living arrangement, or no fixed place of residence. A transient can be a homeless individual (i.e., someone who sleeps in doorways, overnight shelters, parks, bus stations, etc.); or a person who stays with a succession of friends or relatives and has no permanent living arrangement.

Residing in an institution (as defined for SSI purposes) can affect an SSI recipient's eligibility and/or payment amount.  Residents of public institutions generally are ineligible for SSI.  The reasoning here is that some other government source is already paying for the individual’s food and shelter, thus, SSI is not needed.  Residents of medical facilities (public or private) may be eligible, but are limited to a maximum Federal payment of $30 a month. However, there are many exceptions to these generalizations. Individuals living in a public shelter for the homeless may only be eligible for SSI for up to 6 months in any 9 month period.  This is an exception to the standard rules which is intended to help homeless persons prepare for more permanent living arrangements.

Household Living Arrangements

A household situation exists when an individual is not a transient or a resident of an institution. It is important to remember that the SSI program defines “household” differently than the physical space in which the beneficiary resides.  For SSI purposes, living within someone else’s household actually means that “someone else” takes financial responsibility for the SSI beneficiary.  Living in one’s own household means that the beneficiary has financial responsibility for his or her own food and shelter--does not equate to living alone.  Here are two examples:
Carol lives with her mother, Adriana.   Carol and her mom pay all costs equally for food, rent, utilities and other basic expenses. Carol receives SSI as a disabled individual.   For the purposes of SSI, Carol is living in her own household.

Carol moves out to an expensive apartment complex.  A rich friend has decided to pay all of Carol’s expenses, including rent, food, utilities, etc.  For the purposes of Carol’s SSI benefit, she is living in the household of another—even though she is living alone.

For purposes of living arrangement determinations and ISM, members of a household do not have to be related by blood or marriage. A person who is temporarily absent from a household is still a member of the household under some very specific circumstances.  SSA applies very specific rules to temporary absences which will be covered a bit later in this document.

Developing Living Arrangements (LA)
The Social Security Administration follows a prescribed sequence in developing an individual’s living arrangement (LA) to ensure that the correct ISM valuation rule is used and that possible sources of ISM are not overlooked or developed unnecessarily. SSA develops the living arrangement only for a person’s permanent residence.  For the purposes of developing LA, a residence is defined as the location of abode or dwelling place. A residence is also a place where a person makes his/her home. In SSA parlance, “residence” is synonymous with the term “permanent living arrangement.”  Below is a brief description of the standard federal living arrangements.
1.  Noninstitutional Care

This situation exists when an individual is placed by a public or private agency under a specific program of protective placement such as foster or family care. To qualify as non-institutional care, the placement must be a private dwelling (not an institution or commercial establishment) which is licensed or otherwise approved by the State to provide foster or family care. The placing agency retains responsibility for continuing supervision of the need for such placement and of the services provided. The individual, the placing agency, or some other third party pays for the food, shelter, and protective supervision provided. (See POMS SI 00835.790 Noninstitutional Care Situations for more information).

2.  Home Ownership

SSA considers an individual to be living in his/her own household when any form of ownership interest in the home belongs to the individual; his/her living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.110 - Home Ownership as LA Basis for more information.
3.  Rental Liability
An individual is living in his own household when there is liability to the landlord for payment of any of the rental charges on the part of the individual; the living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual. Room rental within a private dwelling is also a form of rental liability. When an individual lives in the same dwelling with the landlord, he/ she must be in a separate household from the landlord's in order to have rental liability. A separate household functions as a separate economic unit, and more than one economic unit may exist in a single dwelling. If the individual and the landlord do not function as separate economic units, the individual is not considered to be in a separate household and cannot have rental liability. An arrangement in which a flat fee for room and board is charged would be another form of rental liability. It is a variation of separate room rental within a private dwelling. With a flat fee arrangement, the individual maintains a separate household from the landlord and pays a flat rate for food and shelter.  See POMS SI 00835.120 - Rental Liability as LA Basis for more information.
4.  Public Assistance (PA) Households
A public assistance household is one in which every member receives some kind of public income maintenance payments (which this section refers to as “PA payments”). These are payments made under:
•	Title IV-A of the Social Security Act - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
•	Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI, including federally administered State supplements and State administered mandatory supplements);
•	The Refugee Act of 1980 (those payments based on need)
•	Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
•	General assistance programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
•	State or local government assistance programs based on need (tax credits or refunds are not assistance based on need), and
•	Department of Veterans Affairs programs (those payments based on need)
See POMS SI 00835.130 - Public Assistance Households for more information.
5.  Separate Consumption
Separate consumption means that an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) is taking all meals outside of the household in which he resides and is not reimbursed by the householder.  For separate consumption LA to apply, the individual must consume all of his/her meals elsewhere.  For more information, see SI 00835.140 - Separate Consumption
6.  Separate Purchase of Food
Separate purchase of food exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) physically shops for his/her own food or gives instructions and money to someone to buy the food for him/her.   Separate purchase of food can exist when an individual shops for his/ her own food but does not use his/her own money.   It may also apply even if the individual uses the same condiments or facilities (e.g., refrigerator, stove) as the rest of the household, or consumes meals at the same time as the rest of the household.  Separate purchase of food can also exist when an eligible spouse or a person whose income may be deemed to the individual buys food on behalf of the individual, but not necessarily only for the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.150 - Separate Purchase of Food for more information.
7.  Sharing
A sharing arrangement exists when an individual's contribution equals or exceeds his or her “pro rata” share of the household operating expenses, provided the household expenses include both food and shelter. Pro rata share is a term SSA uses to refer to an individual's share of the household operating expenses computed by dividing the household operating expenses by the number of persons permanently residing in the household. The pro rata share represents the dollar value of the individual's food and shelter received from within the household.  If the individual pays his/her pro rata share, he/she is not considered to be receiving any ISM from within the household. For additional information, refer to POMS SI 00835.160 - Sharing
8.  Earmarked Sharing
Earmarked sharing exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) designates part or all of his or her contribution toward household operating expenses for food or shelter and the contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of household expenses for food or shelter.  For example, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for shelter only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share for shelter, earmarked sharing exists.  Similarly, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for food only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of food expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of food expenses, earmarked sharing exists.
When an individual earmarks a specific portion of his contribution for food and another specific portion for shelter, it is called double earmarking. SSA computes the individual's pro rata share of food expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for food. Similarly, they compute the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for shelter. If either earmarked contribution equals or exceeds a pro rata share of the item for which it is earmarked (either food or shelter), earmarked sharing LA is determined.  See POMS SI 00835.170 - Earmarked Sharing for more information.
SSA gathers the information necessary to make LA determinations by interviewing the beneficiary and/or the representative payee or legal guardian.  The form SSA-8006-F4 is an interviewing and development tool which Claims Representatives often use for developing living arrangement (LA) and in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) issues. The answers to the questions on the SSA-8006-F4 document the individual's allegations regarding LA basis and cash income received from within and outside a household.
SSA may use an additional form (SSA-8011-F3) to verify things such as household operating expenses; the individual's contribution to household operating expenses, separate consumption, separate purchase of food, or earmarked contributions.  Samples of these forms are provided at the end of this document under the “Conducting Independent Research” section.
The LA decision is important because it determines which rule SSA uses to calculate the value of the ISM.  The value that is placed on the ISM is what affects the monthly SSI payment amount.  A detailed discussion of how the ISM valuation rules work is provided a bit later in this document.


Temporary Absences

Temporary absence is an individBasically, in-kind support and maintenance (also known as ISM) is unearned income attributable to an SSI eligible individual in the form of food or shelter that is given to the individual or received because someone else pays for it.  In-kind support may be provided by someone who lives in the same household as the recipient (such as a parent), or by someone outside of the household.

In-kind support and maintenance matters in the SSI program because SSI is intended to help pay for the basic costs of food and shelter.  If someone else is helping to pay for these things, then it stands to reason that the SSI would be reduced.  If too much ISM is received and other forms of income are in evidence, it may even cause a person to be found ineligible for SSI benefits.  For people who are found eligible for SSI, in-kind support and maintenance can cause the benefit payment to be reduced.  In-kind support and maintenance may be charged to an SSI eligible individual or an SSI eligible couple.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on a change in the SSI regulations, receipt of clothing is not counted as ISM beginning 03/09/2005. As of this date, only food and shelter are considered during ISM determinations.


When ISM is NOT Charged

The general rule is to charge ISM to an individual when he or she receives food or shelter, regardless of who is liable for payment of the cost of the food or shelter item received. However, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule. When an exception applies, the food or shelter an individual receives is not chargeable ISM.  Some of these exceptions result from statutory exclusions while other exceptions result from situations in which the food or shelter received does not constitute income in accordance with SSA regulations. SSA does not charge ISM when an individual receives food or shelter which:
•	Is specifically excluded by Federal law, (e.g., the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). (SI 00830.099);
•	Meets the criteria for exclusion of infrequent or irregular unearned income (SI 00810.410);
•	Has no current market value (SI 00835.320);
•	Is provided under a governmental (Federal, State, or local) medical or social service program (SI 00815.050);
•	Is assistance based on need (ABON) from a State or one of its political subdivisions (SI 00830.175);
•	Is food or shelter received during a temporary absence (SI 00835.040);
•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	Is received as a replacement of a lost, damaged or stolen resource. This includes temporary housing (SI 01130.630);
•	Is excluded under an approved Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) (SI 00870.001 ff.);
•	Is received because of payments made under the terms of a credit life or credit disability policy (SI 00815.300); or
•	Is received during medical confinement in an institution (SI 00815.100).

Relationship between ISM and Deeming

“Deeming” is the term the Social Security Administration uses to describe the process of considering another person’s income and/or resources to be available for meeting an SSI claimant’s (or recipient’s) basic need for food and shelter. The concept of deeming is based on the notion that those who have a responsibility for others share their income and resources for the benefit of these persons. Deeming relationships include:

•	the parental relationship to a minor child,
•	a spouse-to-spouse relationship, and
•	the relationship between a sponsor and a legal alien.

In these situations, SSA determines that a certain amount of the responsible party’s income and/or resources are “deemed” available for the welfare of the SSI claimant or recipient.  SSA considers this “deemed” income and/or resources when someone first applies for SSI, and when figuring the SSI payment amount for individuals already found eligible.  For more information about deeming, refer to additional briefing papers posted to the WIPA NTC website at: http://www.vcu-ntc.org/resources/briefpapers.cfm
If income is deemed from the parent(s) to an eligible child, SSA will NOT also charge ISM from the parent(s) to that child.  However, if in-kind support and maintenance is being provided to the eligible child by some other party from outside of the household, SSA will charge that to the child in addition to any income deemed from the parent(s).
Keep in mind that once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA considers the person to be an adult.  From that point forward, parent-to-child deeming stops.  As of the 18th birthday, SSA no longer considers the income or resources of the parents when making eligibility determinations and calculating payment amount.  There are no exceptions to this rule, even if the parents have been appointed as the legal guardian of the young adult with the disability.  Parent-to-child deeming never applies to an SSI recipient who is 18 years of age or older.
While the parent’s income and resources are no longer relevant once an SSI recipient turns 18, SSA continues to be concerned about whether the parents (or anyone else for that matter) are helping the individual pay for the costs of food and shelter.  After the 18th birthday has occurred and the individual has successfully established eligibility for SSI under the adult rules, SSA will look to see whether or not in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is in evidence.  For an SSI recipient aged 18 or older, ISM may be provided from within the household by the parent(s), from outside of the household by any other party, or even from both.
In situations in which spouse-to-spouse or sponsor-to-alien deeming is occurring, similar ISM rules apply.  It is possible for ISM to be simultaneously assessed in situations where deeming occurs if the in-kind support and maintenance is provided by someone other than the deemor.  SSA will not charge ISM if it is provided by someone living in the same household whose income is already subject to deeming to the individual.


Relationship between ISM and Living Arrangement

The first step in the process of determining if ISM is in evidence is to determine which living arrangement (LA) the individual is in.  How in-kind support and maintenance is viewed by SSA and the value that is placed upon it depends upon the living arrangement an individual is determined to be in.  SSA begins this process by collecting evidence about the individual’s living situation and deciding whether the person resides in a “household” or “non-household”.   Social Security has very specific definitions that they apply here which are described below.

Non-Household Living Arrangements

A non-household situation exists if the recipient is either a transient or a resident of an institution.  A transient is defined by SSA as someone with no permanent living arrangement, or no fixed place of residence. A transient can be a homeless individual (i.e., someone who sleeps in doorways, overnight shelters, parks, bus stations, etc.); or a person who stays with a succession of friends or relatives and has no permanent living arrangement.

Residing in an institution (as defined for SSI purposes) can affect an SSI recipient's eligibility and/or payment amount.  Residents of public institutions generally are ineligible for SSI.  The reasoning here is that some other government source is already paying for the individual’s food and shelter, thus, SSI is not needed.  Residents of medical facilities (public or private) may be eligible, but are limited to a maximum Federal payment of $30 a month. However, there are many exceptions to these generalizations. Individuals living in a public shelter for the homeless may only be eligible for SSI for up to 6 months in any 9 month period.  This is an exception to the standard rules which is intended to help homeless persons prepare for more permanent living arrangements.

Household Living Arrangements

A household situation exists when an individual is not a transient or a resident of an institution. It is important to remember that the SSI program defines “household” differently than the physical space in which the beneficiary resides.  For SSI purposes, living within someone else’s household actually means that “someone else” takes financial responsibility for the SSI beneficiary.  Living in one’s own household means that the beneficiary has financial responsibility for his or her own food and shelter--does not equate to living alone.  Here are two examples:
Carol lives with her mother, Adriana.   Carol and her mom pay all costs equally for food, rent, utilities and other basic expenses. Carol receives SSI as a disabled individual.   For the purposes of SSI, Carol is living in her own household.

Carol moves out to an expensive apartment complex.  A rich friend has decided to pay all of Carol’s expenses, including rent, food, utilities, etc.  For the purposes of Carol’s SSI benefit, she is living in the household of another—even though she is living alone.

For purposes of living arrangement determinations and ISM, members of a household do not have to be related by blood or marriage. A person who is temporarily absent from a household is still a member of the household under some very specific circumstances.  SSA applies very specific rules to temporary absences which will be covered a bit later in this document.

Developing Living Arrangements (LA)
The Social Security Administration follows a prescribed sequence in developing an individual’s living arrangement (LA) to ensure that the correct ISM valuation rule is used and that possible sources of ISM are not overlooked or developed unnecessarily. SSA develops the living arrangement only for a person’s permanent residence.  For the purposes of developing LA, a residence is defined as the location of abode or dwelling place. A residence is also a place where a person makes his/her home. In SSA parlance, “residence” is synonymous with the term “permanent living arrangement.”  Below is a brief description of the standard federal living arrangements.
1.  Noninstitutional Care

This situation exists when an individual is placed by a public or private agency under a specific program of protective placement such as foster or family care. To qualify as non-institutional care, the placement must be a private dwelling (not an institution or commercial establishment) which is licensed or otherwise approved by the State to provide foster or family care. The placing agency retains responsibility for continuing supervision of the need for such placement and of the services provided. The individual, the placing agency, or some other third party pays for the food, shelter, and protective supervision provided. (See POMS SI 00835.790 Noninstitutional Care Situations for more information).

2.  Home Ownership

SSA considers an individual to be living in his/her own household when any form of ownership interest in the home belongs to the individual; his/her living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.110 - Home Ownership as LA Basis for more information.
3.  Rental Liability
An individual is living in his own household when there is liability to the landlord for payment of any of the rental charges on the part of the individual; the living-with eligible spouse; or any person whose income may be deemed to the individual. Room rental within a private dwelling is also a form of rental liability. When an individual lives in the same dwelling with the landlord, he/ she must be in a separate household from the landlord's in order to have rental liability. A separate household functions as a separate economic unit, and more than one economic unit may exist in a single dwelling. If the individual and the landlord do not function as separate economic units, the individual is not considered to be in a separate household and cannot have rental liability. An arrangement in which a flat fee for room and board is charged would be another form of rental liability. It is a variation of separate room rental within a private dwelling. With a flat fee arrangement, the individual maintains a separate household from the landlord and pays a flat rate for food and shelter.  See POMS SI 00835.120 - Rental Liability as LA Basis for more information.
4.  Public Assistance (PA) Households
A public assistance household is one in which every member receives some kind of public income maintenance payments (which this section refers to as “PA payments”). These are payments made under:
•	Title IV-A of the Social Security Act - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
•	Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI, including federally administered State supplements and State administered mandatory supplements);
•	The Refugee Act of 1980 (those payments based on need)
•	Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
•	General assistance programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
•	State or local government assistance programs based on need (tax credits or refunds are not assistance based on need), and
•	Department of Veterans Affairs programs (those payments based on need)
See POMS SI 00835.130 - Public Assistance Households for more information.
5.  Separate Consumption
Separate consumption means that an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) is taking all meals outside of the household in which he resides and is not reimbursed by the householder.  For separate consumption LA to apply, the individual must consume all of his/her meals elsewhere.  For more information, see SI 00835.140 - Separate Consumption
6.  Separate Purchase of Food
Separate purchase of food exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) physically shops for his/her own food or gives instructions and money to someone to buy the food for him/her.   Separate purchase of food can exist when an individual shops for his/ her own food but does not use his/her own money.   It may also apply even if the individual uses the same condiments or facilities (e.g., refrigerator, stove) as the rest of the household, or consumes meals at the same time as the rest of the household.  Separate purchase of food can also exist when an eligible spouse or a person whose income may be deemed to the individual buys food on behalf of the individual, but not necessarily only for the individual.  See POMS SI 00835.150 - Separate Purchase of Food for more information.
7.  Sharing
A sharing arrangement exists when an individual's contribution equals or exceeds his or her “pro rata” share of the household operating expenses, provided the household expenses include both food and shelter. Pro rata share is a term SSA uses to refer to an individual's share of the household operating expenses computed by dividing the household operating expenses by the number of persons permanently residing in the household. The pro rata share represents the dollar value of the individual's food and shelter received from within the household.  If the individual pays his/her pro rata share, he/she is not considered to be receiving any ISM from within the household. For additional information, refer to POMS SI 00835.160 - Sharing
8.  Earmarked Sharing
Earmarked sharing exists when an individual (or at least one member of an eligible couple) designates part or all of his or her contribution toward household operating expenses for food or shelter and the contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of household expenses for food or shelter.  For example, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for shelter only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share for shelter, earmarked sharing exists.  Similarly, if the individual's contribution is earmarked for food only, SSA determines the individual's pro rata share of food expenses. If the earmarked contribution equals or exceeds the pro rata share of food expenses, earmarked sharing exists.
When an individual earmarks a specific portion of his contribution for food and another specific portion for shelter, it is called double earmarking. SSA computes the individual's pro rata share of food expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for food. Similarly, they compute the individual's pro rata share of shelter expenses and compare it to the portion of the contribution earmarked for shelter. If either earmarked contribution equals or exceeds a pro rata share of the item for which it is earmarked (either food or shelter), earmarked sharing LA is determined.  See POMS SI 00835.170 - Earmarked Sharing for more information.
SSA gathers the information necessary to make LA determinations by interviewing the beneficiary and/or the representative payee or legal guardian.  The form SSA-8006-F4 is an interviewing and development tool which Claims Representatives often use for developing living arrangement (LA) and in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) issues. The answers to the questions on the SSA-8006-F4 document the individual's allegations regarding LA basis and cash income received from within and outside a household.
SSA may use an additional form (SSA-8011-F3) to verify things such as household operating expenses; the individual's contribution to household operating expenses, separate consumption, separate purchase of food, or earmarked contributions.  Samples of these forms are provided at the end of this document under the “Conducting Independent Research” section.
The LA decision is important because it determines which rule SSA uses to calculate the value of the ISM.  The value that is placed on the ISM is what affects the monthly SSI payment amount.  A detailed discussion of how the ISM valuation rules work is provided a bit later in this document.
